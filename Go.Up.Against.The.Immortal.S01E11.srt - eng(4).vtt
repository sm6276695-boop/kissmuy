WEBVTT

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:21.420
Mother

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.960
Mother

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.719
Mother

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:26.800
Why are you here?

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:30.239
Mother

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.079
Mother

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:33.380
Mother

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:36.420
Sect Leader

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:38.039
Why is my mother like this?

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.719
You should ask your mother

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.100
why her soul was sacrificed to Dugu Zhantian

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:44.219
and still survived.

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:45.500
Sect Leader

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.840
How do you know

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.280
my mother's soul was sacrificed to Dugu Zhantian?

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:51.979
I also know

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:54.299
someone took the remnants of your mother's soul

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:56.119
the undigested part

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.280
and combined it with Spirit Hound flesh to make a Spirit Hound Pill

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.060
which saved your mother's life.

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:02.140
Spirit Hound Pill

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.939
The Spirit Hound clan is full of treasures.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.859
Their flesh and blood can be used as spiritual medicine.

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:09.159
It can boost cultivation.

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:10.680
And heal serious injuries.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.560
But the Spirit Hound clan

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:14.540
has always been friendly with our people.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.959
There are no permanent allies,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.180
only eternal interests.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.000
Lord Dugu Zhantian

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.099
He thinks highly of you.

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:26.799
As long as you know your place,

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:29.260
you can take your mother away right now.

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:34.000
Sect Leader

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.599
What did you just say?

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.540
You called Dugu Zhantian "Lord"?

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.879
You're colluding with the Demon Sect!

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.659
Colluding? That's such an ugly word.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.739
A wise man submits to circumstances.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.500
A hundred years ago, the strongest heads of the four great clans all died in battle.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.019
Only then was the Demon Lord sealed.

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:00.519
Now the Lord has returned.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.280
The descendants of the four clans are far weaker than before.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.980
The merit of backing the rising power

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.159
is something I don't want to miss.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.520
You're right.

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:14.860
So, Lord Dugu Zhantian

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.860
where is he now?

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.360
The Lord is in seclusion.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.099
Yuanqi

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.240
As long as you serve us,

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.439
I can free you from your Lowborn Swordsman Status

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.699
and make you a clan disciple.

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:31.560
You'll enjoy endless wealth and glory.

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:33.680
Bring the wine.

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:41.099
Come.

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:42.659
Drink this cup.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.240
From now on, we'll be allies.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.699
Sect Leader

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.379
The wine is good,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.479
but for me, Chen Yuanqi,

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.860
my mother

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.319
is not a bargaining chip.

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:08.099
Your mother is missing a soul and a spirit.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.879
If you agree,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.800
when the Lord rules the world,

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.400
he can heal your mother.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:16.340
What do you say?

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:17.360
And the Spirit Hound clan?

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.580
What will happen to them?

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.379
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.639
They're just spirit beasts.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.360
If they die, so be it.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.139
What if

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:30.379
I refuse?

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.379
I'm sincere.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.300
And I don't want to be disappointed.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.780
Fine.

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:43.020
Sect Leader

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:46.699
I understand what you mean.

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.580
This first cup

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.300
I offer to my mother.

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:59.699
Failing to protect her is my shame.

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.939
But I will stand tall as a true man.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.039
I will never let my mother down.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:12.960
This second cup,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.460
I offer to the fallen Spirit Hounds,

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:16.939
and to those

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:18.160
slain by the Fu Clan

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.139
and the Demon Sect—innocent lives lost.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:24.199
I, Chen Yuanqi, know right from wrong.

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.519
One day,

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.420
I will avenge them.

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:35.100
This third cup,

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.699
I offer to the gods,

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.860
to the heavens above who witness all.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.120
Listen well, Tang Tianyuan.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.980
There should be no rich or poor among our people.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.199
But even if there is,

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:54.660
I’ll use my sword

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.160
to carve out a world where all stand equal,

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:59.139
where the poor have a place.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:07.800
Mark my words—

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:09.399
from this day on,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.980
I am your enemy, and the Tianyuan Sect is mine.

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:19.000
Mother,

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:20.920
I’m taking you home.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.339
Get him!

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.300
Cripple him!

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:44.660
Chen Yuanqi!

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.279
Will you serve the Lord of the Demon Sect or not?

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.220
I, Chen Yuanqi,

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:51.540
swear I never will!

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.560
Then I’ll grant your wish.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.259
How pathetic.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.540
Lie Shumei.

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:15.000
Thank you.

00:06:15.459 --> 00:06:16.360
I didn’t save you by choice.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.420
The Chiyou Sword wouldn’t let you die.

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:19.740
But

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.639
I can’t stand this bunch of bastards even more.

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:23.339
They’re even more of an eyesore.

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:25.459
Fine.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.759
Lie Shumei,

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.680
let’s fight our way out together!

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.860
Go!

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:22.279
Wait, Yuanqi.

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:24.740
Your mother's soul is broken and lost.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.639
Don’t you want to save your mother?

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.779
How can I save her?

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.439
It’s not certain who will die yet.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.000
All’s fair in war.

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:45.160
You’re draining my power.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.199
All’s fair in war—I learned it from you.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:50.860
Spare me.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.939
I was wrong.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.519
I know the Guanghan Jiang Clan has a treasure.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:56.540
The Soul Jade.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.459
It can mend souls.

00:07:57.639 --> 00:07:58.339
Let me live.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.680
I’ll serve you.

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:01.079
I’ll help you get the treasure.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.180
My lord.

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:04.180
I beg you.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.120
Sounds like a good offer.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.620
Hard to refuse, isn’t it?

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.600
How *wise*, Yuanqi.

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:11.220
No.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.139
My lord.

00:08:12.819 --> 00:08:14.259
Then put down your sword.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:15.800
What a pity.

00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:19.279
To join forces with a righteous parasite like you—

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.579
I fear my mother would think me filthy.

00:08:22.339 --> 00:08:24.339
What do you mean?

00:08:24.899 --> 00:08:25.839
I mean—

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.379
I’ll take the Soul Jade myself.

00:08:28.819 --> 00:08:31.139
You will die today.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:09.899
Brother Yuanqi,

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.000
Brother Yuanqi,

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:14.659
Don’t scare me.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.000
Wake up, Brother Yuanqi!

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.480
Brother Yuanqi!

00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:19.659
Wake up, Brother Yuanqi!

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.720
His soul is on the verge of shattering.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.159
He’s doomed to die.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.159
Let me possess his body instead.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.659
That way, his body won’t be destroyed.

00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:27.299
No, you can’t!

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:28.419
Step aside.

00:09:29.379 --> 00:09:30.980
You just want to save your own people.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.200
If I possess him, I can help you save them too.

00:09:33.399 --> 00:09:34.399
But you’re not him.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:34.899
You—

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.480
Then don’t blame me for being ruthless.
