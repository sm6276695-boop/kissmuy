[Episode 17]

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.870
I'm the Military Commissioner
of Jiang City.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.950
Tongce, it's been quite a while.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.760
You...

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.070
Why?

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.790
You look quite surprised to see me.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.910
I left home to venture out
four years ago.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.310
I didn't say I wouldn't return.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.360
Why do you look
as if you've seen a ghost?

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.680
It's not like that.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.190
I just

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.360
didn't expect

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.870
you'd return as a Military Commissioner.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.710
You could've at least given me notice.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.870
So I could arrange a proper welcome.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.150
Now that I am a Military Commissioner,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.280
I should keep a distance from you
to avoid suspicion.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.430
Besides,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.710
I'm coming home.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.910
Could it be

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.910
that I need your permission
for that now?

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.680
You're always welcome home.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.800
But making such a spectacle of it

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.840
would make others think

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.360
something had happened
in the Military Governor's Mansion.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.000
Gossip is a fearful thing.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.360
You've been through it yourself.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.710
Especially now that you're an official,

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.960
you should be even more careful.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.470
Of course, I cannot compare with you.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.280
You've been in officialdom for years.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.190
You're thorough in everything.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.910
Now I've come under the order
of the Inspector

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.190
to carefully review

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.750
every bit of your work

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.000
and to learn well from it.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:20.720
In time,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.190
there's much
I'll need to learn from you.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.280
The two of us

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.000
have plenty of time ahead.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.360
Today I just came by to say hello.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.000
Nothing else.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:36.400
I'll take my leave.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.280
Take care.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.430
Wu,

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.560
it's been four years

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.120
since you saved me.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.120
I still don't know where Minghui is

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.470
or whether she's doing well.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.800
She had you secretly save me,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.680
probably because she wanted

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.120
to lessen her guilt.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.680
Mr. Gu, do you still resent her?

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.630
What right do I have to do that?

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.510
She's only a girl

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.480
losing her entire family

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.310
because of my father.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.720
I'll have the men start looking

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.120
for Madam starting tomorrow.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.560
Good.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.840
Stop!

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.630
Mr. Gu!

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.310
It's been a while.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.720
I'm not dreaming.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.310
It really is you.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.270
How have you been all these years?

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:11.920
Have your injuries healed?

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.390
Has Gu Tongce given you trouble?

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.630
Don't worry.

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.950
Now that I'm back,

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.560
I'll protect you well.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.680
What's wrong?

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.360
It's me.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.390
I'm back.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.000
Welcome back, Mr. Gu.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.360
Mother, I've washed my hands clean.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.750
Good girl, Hongdou.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:51.870
All clean.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.920
This child...

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.680
My daughter.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.120
Hongdou, this is your uncle.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.950
Uncle.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.070
Who is your father?

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.000
My father is the Military Governor.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:28.270
His name is Gu Tongce.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.950
Why are you still here?

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.160
Do you want to celebrate
my daughter's birthday?

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.750
Hongdou,

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:04.920
happy birthday.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.360
I'll make it up to you
with a gift another day.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.160
I have things to do.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.310
I'll see you.

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.180
Miss Chu, is your family
not with you today?

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.030
Family...

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.740
Whatever it is, just tell me directly.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.100
You may have at most...

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.580
one or two months left.

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.620
Why did I have to meet him
at this exact time?

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:24.860
Gu Tongpei,

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.140
perhaps, I was fated to be your curse.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.500
I'm sorry.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.140
This time,

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.780
I'll have to rely on
your strength again.

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:36.220
Because...

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.580
I have someone I must protect now.

00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:53.860
Forty.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.900
For a child this small,

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.340
bone-contouring surgery
isn't recommended.

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:06.300
The risk is too high.

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.540
You may leave now.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:21.580
Sure.

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.300
Hongdou, come here.

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:31.420
Go play in the garden for a while, okay?

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:32.780
I'll come find you later.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:35.420
Go.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.340
What are you trying to do
to Hongdou again?

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.140
She looks less and less like me.

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.900
Rumors are everywhere.

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.980
I will let them know

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:00.180
that she is my daughter.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.380
What are you laughing at?

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.700
Don't think that Gu Tongpei's return

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.140
means you two can get back together.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.940
You are my wife now.

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.500
He just came back,

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:11.740
and you were already desperate
to meet him,

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.140
even right in front of Hongdou.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.340
You really have no shame.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.140
That's not true.

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.700
Don't think you can escape me.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.340
You're nothing but a weakling.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.300
There's no way

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:32.260
you can protect your old flame

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.380
and your daughter at the same time.

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:46.380
Mr. Gu.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:48.780
What is it?

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:49.980
We just received word.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.380
Tonight, Gu Tongpei will be

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:52.900
at Palace of Joy for inspection.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:54.780
Let him.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.020
Tell our men to be careful.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.180
A new official always makes
a show of their power.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.300
I'll let him enjoy his moment.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.060
Go.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:05.700
Yes.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:29.380
I've put on so much powder.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.780
How come there are still wounds
showing through?

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.220
Mother, are you going out this late?

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.060
Hongdou,

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:53.820
I'm going out

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:55.740
to buy a little cake for you.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.020
But you must promise me

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.900
to keep this a secret

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.340
and not to tell Father, okay?

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.580
Be good and go to sleep.

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.780
I'll be back, okay?

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:12.500
