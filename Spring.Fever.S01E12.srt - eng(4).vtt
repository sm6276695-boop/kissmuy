Swallow it.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.280
Feeling any better?

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.160
Not yet.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.160
This medicine is too strong.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.680
Are you still running a fever?

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.240
Yes.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.944
What should we do?

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.040
Good work, guys.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.080
Come on. Drink.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.920

Out of wine! Get more!

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.840
Enjoy the food, boss.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.600
Wine's coming.

Hurry!

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.480
How are you going
to handle the Governor-General?

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.040
It's troublesome.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.880
How many men did we lose to him
at the Goddess Temple?

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.240
Let me kill him outright.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.880
Didn't the master say

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.160
to wait for his word before we act?

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.280
If I can't touch him,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.824
can't I deal with that woman instead?

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.440
Guys,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.360
watch how I take that woman down.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.800
Come on!

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.000
Guys, let's go there after the drink.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.800
- Okay!
- Okay!

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.360
Scar.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.920
Coming.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.320
Hurry, Scar.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.280
I'm coming, boss.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.720
Come on, boss.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.080
Fill it up.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.600
So you actually woke up?

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.200
Impressive.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.800
But with the soft muscle powder,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.720
you won't be moving anytime soon.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.440
Soft muscle powder?

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.640
- What are you doing?
- Let her go. Take me instead!

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.160
Just watch how I will have fun

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.400
with this beauty.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.840
Let me go.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.600
My beauty.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.400
What are you doing?

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.120
- Let's have fun.
- What are you doing?

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.440
Let go of me.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.840
Let go of me!

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.960
Let go of me!

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.080
Let go of me!

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.520
What's happening?

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.640
There's really a mole.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.160
No wonder you weren't drugged.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.520
Turns out it has been swapped.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.880
Quiet. If you want to live, go with us.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.640
Drop the act, Lord Shen.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.960
You won't escape.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.400
You weren't drugged?

Stop!

Your hand's hurt.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.800
It's fine. But I'm truly poisoned now.

Yes. You're dreaming.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.360
It scared me. It's really just a dream.

Scar,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.360
after hiding for years,

00:10:50.496 --> 00:10:51.760
you've finally shown yourself.

I'll tell you

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.320
Keep dreaming.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.400
It's in the textile shop
at the Baiyi Alley.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.760
I'll hold them off.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.000
You go first.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.040
Escape via the waterway behind.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.080
Hold your breath.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.400
Float like a lotus leaf.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.312
Drift with the current
and you'll be safe.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.600
Sister, when swimming,
float like a lotus leaf.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.400
If you can float, you'll be safe.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.240
I just want you to keep playing
with me like this.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.520
You're my brother?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.960
You're alive?

00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:43.600
Kill him!

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.680
Stop!

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.640
Nobody moves! Stay put!

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.720
Shen Que.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:52.960
Take her away.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:54.040
You can't die yet.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:54.960
Leave this to me.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.120
Go!

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:58.752
Move.

00:11:58.752 --> 00:11:59.200
Shen Que!

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.040
Go!

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:34.760
It's fine.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.120
I'm okay.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.520
You've been hiding here all these years?

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.320
I was scared as a child.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.840
So I drifted outside for years.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:51.520
Later, I was caught by bandits
and forced into labor,

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.240
which ironically kept me safe.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.400
I slept peacefully too.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.280
You'd already escaped the woods.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.760
Why did you come back?

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.720
- Why did you...
- Back then...

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:14.720
Back then,

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.368
Princess Anhe's
handwritten accusation letter

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.000
was in the bundle you gave me.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.680
Only by letting them know I'm alive,

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.560
can you stay safe.

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.560
I'm sorry.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.880
I should've been the one
taking care of you.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.080
I'm sorry.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.320
I'm sorry.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.760
Sister,

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.480
we shouldn't wait long
for Lord Shen here.

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.640
Taodu's crawling with pirates.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.280
We must find another place soon.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:08.960
Attack!

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:17.440
After them!

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.640
This way.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.784
Where'd they go? After them!

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.480
Sis, no time for details.

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.320
Just listen.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.192
Once past this door, pirates thin out.

00:14:40.192 --> 00:14:42.600
The accusation letter is
in the textile shop at Baiyi Alley.

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.152
Deliver it personally to the Young Lord
of Duke Xuan's Mansion.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.520
Mu, we'll survive together

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.400
and clear the Sang family's name.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.520
There's no time.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.320
There they are! After them!

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:55.640
Go! Hurry!

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.120
Mu!

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:56.600
Go!

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.600
Mu, let's go together.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.120
Go!

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.000
Mu, what're you doing?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.800
Mu!

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.200
Mu, open the door!

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:02.920
Why?

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.160
They killed Princess Anhe.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.320
The Lu family and Prefect Xia
are in cahoots,

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.720
deceiving the people of Ningzhou.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.880
You must live.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.160
Open up! Listen to me!

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:15.600
Open the door!

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.880
For Jin!

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:18.400
For our parents!

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.080
Mu!

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.800
For all of Ningzhou!

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.520
Open the door!

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.560
Mu!

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.880
Mu, open the door!

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.600
Go, Sister!

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.160
We must live together.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:34.800
Go!

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.360
Sometimes living requires
more courage than dying.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.040
- Mu!
- Go!

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:44.760
No hesitation. No cowardice. Go!

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.320
- No! Open the door!
- Don't make me look down on you.

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:49.920
Mu!

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.320
My cover is blown.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.840
You must avenge
what remains of our grievances.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.080
Mu.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.120
Open the door.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.080
(If I die, only you know
where the evidence is.)

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.960
(So you can survive.)

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:26.480
I'm begging you, Mu.

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.680
Open the door.
