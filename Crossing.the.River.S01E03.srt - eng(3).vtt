00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:03.083
Welcome.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.041
Hello, do you have a reservation?

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:24.625
This person,

00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:27.166
does he live here?

00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:28.041
Yes.

00:01:28.583 --> 00:01:29.708
May I ask, what is your relationship with him?

00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:31.500
He is my fiancé.

00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:35.208
Has anyone come to see him recently?

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.750
No one has really come to see him.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.083
Oh.

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:45.958
There was a man about his age

00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:47.166
who came to see him a few times.

00:02:22.916 --> 00:02:23.916
This gentleman

00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:25.000
looks familiar.

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:26.291
I think I've seen him somewhere before.

00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:34.208
Yes, we've met.

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:36.375
At Jinling Hotel.

00:02:37.083 --> 00:02:38.375
I apologize for that day.

00:02:38.916 --> 00:02:40.291
I accidentally bumped into your handbag.

00:02:40.833 --> 00:02:41.666
Sorry for the rudeness.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.333
No wonder you look so familiar.

00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:45.250
I knew I'd seen you somewhere.

00:02:45.708 --> 00:02:46.791
Pleased to meet you.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.500
You didn't do it on purpose.

00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:49.583
It's all right.

00:02:53.875 --> 00:02:54.958
Jinling Fuhai Machinery Factory.

00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:55.791
Zhao Jiaqi.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.750
I appreciate your support.

00:02:58.625 --> 00:02:59.916
Teacher at Jinling Women's College.

00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:00.875
Xia Yuying.

00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:02.833
Boss Zhao.

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:03.791
An industrialist.

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:04.916
I admire you.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.833
Oh, it's just a small business.

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:08.833
Teacher Xia.

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:09.583
Please have a seat.

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:17.541
Given the current situation,

00:03:18.083 --> 00:03:20.041
running a business must be tough.

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:21.875
Times are chaotic.

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:23.125
Business is hard.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.125
It's very difficult.

00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:27.875
I was thinking,

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.833
maybe I could visit your factory someday.

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:32.166
to learn a thing or two.

00:03:32.916 --> 00:03:34.708
Would that be convenient for you, Boss Zhao?

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.791
Of course.

00:03:36.708 --> 00:03:38.041
Miss Xia, your visit would be an honor.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.500
You're welcome anytime.

00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:44.875
Boss,

00:03:45.166 --> 00:03:45.916
we should go.

00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:47.375
Right now.

00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:53.333
I'm very sorry, Miss Xia.

00:03:53.791 --> 00:03:54.333
I must excuse myself.

00:04:10.666 --> 00:04:11.541
I'll be at Fuhai

00:04:11.791 --> 00:04:13.041
waiting for your visit.

00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:14.291
Goodbye.

00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:15.583
Farewell.

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:22.375
Waiter,

00:04:22.708 --> 00:04:23.291
I'd like a cup of coffee.

00:04:57.916 --> 00:04:58.791
The 79th Division

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:00.791
can be contacted now.

00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:02.291
Yes.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.791
I heard Commander Wang has been feeling more lost lately.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.875
We need to strike while the iron is hot.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.208
Actively work for it.

00:05:10.208 --> 00:05:10.708
Mm.

00:05:11.375 --> 00:05:12.875
Commander Wang’s 79th Division

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.625
is part of the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang).

00:05:15.583 --> 00:05:16.250
It’s a major division.

00:05:16.791 --> 00:05:17.875
Cooperating with him

00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:19.125
is very important.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.583
I’ve made some preparations.

00:05:22.791 --> 00:05:24.458
I bought two northeastern wild ginseng roots.

00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:27.208
And I got a black pearl necklace for his wife.

00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:28.625
I

00:05:28.791 --> 00:05:30.250
hope to get closer to them soon.

00:05:30.875 --> 00:05:31.916
So we can work together as soon as possible.

00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:32.833
Mm.

00:05:33.541 --> 00:05:34.541
It’s worth trying for.

00:05:35.875 --> 00:05:38.416
But right now, there’s a more urgent task.

00:05:38.791 --> 00:05:39.458
What task?

00:05:40.625 --> 00:05:41.375
There’s a batch of medicine

00:05:41.958 --> 00:05:42.875
that needs to be shipped to Jiangbei.

00:05:43.875 --> 00:05:44.708
How much is there?

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:46.625
How many boats do we need?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.125
Not much, actually.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.333
A small boat will be enough.

00:05:50.916 --> 00:05:52.583
But time is tight.

00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:55.166
Patrols along Jiangbei are strict now.

00:05:56.125 --> 00:05:56.666
It’s hard to get it out.

00:06:06.791 --> 00:06:07.791
We’ll use a diversion tactic.

00:06:09.541 --> 00:06:11.916
Go from the abandoned dock at Shatou Town.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.041
Create chaos below the dock.

00:06:15.916 --> 00:06:17.791
Draw all the enemies from above the dock.

00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:19.583
We’ll launch the boat amidst the chaos.

00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:22.666
Alright.

00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:38.541
Grandmother.

00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:40.875
I’m back, Grandmother.

00:06:42.083 --> 00:06:43.500
Jiaqi is back, Aunt.

00:06:44.166 --> 00:06:45.208
Come in, quickly.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:45.916
Alright, Aunt.

00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:47.791
Okay, Uncle, take it slow.

00:06:47.791 --> 00:06:48.125
Alright.

00:06:51.833 --> 00:06:52.583
Sit down, sit down.

00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:53.166
Alright, come on.

00:06:53.208 --> 00:06:53.708
Sit down, sit down.

00:06:53.708 --> 00:06:54.166
Alright, alright.

00:06:54.291 --> 00:06:54.833
Uncle, you all sit too.

00:07:00.375 --> 00:07:00.750
Jiaqi,

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.708
It’s been ten years since you left Nanjing, hasn’t it?

00:07:03.458 --> 00:07:04.416
More than eight years.

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:05.750
Where did you go?

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:07.291
Why didn’t we hear from you at all?

00:07:08.083 --> 00:07:08.666
I went to the northeast.

00:07:09.083 --> 00:07:10.500
Did some business there.

00:07:11.125 --> 00:07:12.625
Well, the situation has been chaotic lately.

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:14.875
So I couldn’t get in touch.

00:07:15.708 --> 00:07:16.875
Sorry for making you and Aunt worry.

00:07:18.041 --> 00:07:19.666
It’s good you’re back, that’s all that matters.

00:07:19.875 --> 00:07:20.541
Aunt,

00:07:21.083 --> 00:07:22.750
How’s my grandmother? Is she well?

00:07:26.291 --> 00:07:27.000
She passed away last year.

00:07:28.291 --> 00:07:29.083
When she left,

00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:31.000
she kept saying your name.

00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:48.041
Let me pay my respects to Grandmother.

00:07:49.708 --> 00:07:50.541
Alright, go ahead.

00:08:12.458 --> 00:08:12.958
Grandmother

00:08:14.791 --> 00:08:15.875
Jiaqi has come back to see you.

00:08:17.625 --> 00:08:18.791
This time Jiaqi is back

00:08:20.125 --> 00:08:20.875
and won't be leaving again.

00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:22.791
Jiaqi

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.208
That's wonderful.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.833
You can finally be with your mother again.

00:08:27.166 --> 00:08:29.208
Your mother missed you so much her hair turned white.

00:08:30.916 --> 00:08:31.625
I'm not leaving.

00:08:32.458 --> 00:08:33.166
I'm not going anywhere.

00:08:33.625 --> 00:08:34.875
So, what are your plans next?

00:08:35.791 --> 00:08:37.000
I'll do some business in Nanjing.

00:08:38.291 --> 00:08:38.833
By the way, Uncle,

00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:40.541
I need a favor.

00:08:41.125 --> 00:08:41.875
Just tell me what you need.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:44.333
I have some materials to sell across the river.

00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:45.875
Our family's boat—

00:08:46.333 --> 00:08:47.166
is it still usable?

00:08:48.125 --> 00:08:49.208
You mean that old little boat?

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:50.541
It can still be of use.

00:08:51.583 --> 00:08:51.875
It's fine.

00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:53.041
I don't have much cargo.

00:08:53.375 --> 00:08:53.916
It won't attract attention.

00:08:54.041 --> 00:08:54.541
That's just right.

00:08:55.625 --> 00:08:56.250
But—

00:08:56.791 --> 00:08:58.666
The police are watching closely these days.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:08:59.833
And also,

00:09:00.291 --> 00:09:00.875
your uncle and I

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:02.583
can't row it anymore.

00:09:02.666 --> 00:09:03.625
What do you know?

00:09:03.916 --> 00:09:05.250
Since the kid brought it up,

00:09:05.458 --> 00:09:06.458
he must have a way.

00:09:07.458 --> 00:09:07.875
Jiaqi,

00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:09.958
it can be used, it can.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.208
That's good, that's good.

00:09:11.708 --> 00:09:13.291
I've already found a boatman.

00:09:13.916 --> 00:09:15.666
We just need the boat when the time comes, Uncle.

00:09:27.125 --> 00:09:27.791
What do you do?

00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:28.625
Oh!

00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:29.625
Sirs,

00:09:30.333 --> 00:09:31.791
I just brought goods back from Shanghai.

00:09:32.166 --> 00:09:32.875
It's all

00:09:33.166 --> 00:09:34.000
Jingdezhen porcelain.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.833
Just trinkets, nothing valuable.

00:09:36.083 --> 00:09:37.333
Enough talking, move aside.

00:09:37.625 --> 00:09:37.916
Step aside.

00:09:38.666 --> 00:09:39.750
Sirs, it's all porcelain.

00:11:53.708 --> 00:11:54.708
What are you doing here?

00:11:55.083 --> 00:11:56.208
Sirs, sirs,

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.875
Still working so late?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.625
What are you up to? Planning to cross the river?

00:11:59.875 --> 00:12:01.166
Oh, cross the river? Not at all.

00:12:01.375 --> 00:12:02.875
This is how we make a living.

00:12:03.083 --> 00:12:04.791
We fix it and rely on it to feed ourselves.

00:12:04.875 --> 00:12:06.458
Do you have a permit? Did you report this?

00:12:06.833 --> 00:12:07.791
Sirs,

00:12:07.875 --> 00:12:09.041
We’re all law-abiding citizens.

00:12:09.291 --> 00:12:11.125
No one would keep this without a permit.

00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:11.875
Hey,

00:12:12.125 --> 00:12:12.791
Sirs, come over here.

00:12:12.916 --> 00:12:13.791
Get out of the way.

00:12:16.458 --> 00:12:17.750
Sirs, sirs,

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:18.250
Move aside.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.291
What’s this?

00:12:39.458 --> 00:12:40.000
Hurry, hurry!

00:12:40.166 --> 00:12:40.625
Get the sack.

00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:41.125
Quick, quick!

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.291
One, two, three.

00:13:39.083 --> 00:13:40.041
Once these two good-for-nothings enter the river,

00:13:40.041 --> 00:13:41.166
Old Liu's family will be in danger.

00:13:41.291 --> 00:13:42.625
We need to help them relocate quickly.

00:13:43.125 --> 00:13:43.791
Tonight.

00:13:43.916 --> 00:13:45.166
They truly understand the bigger picture.

00:13:45.166 --> 00:13:45.541
Let's go.
