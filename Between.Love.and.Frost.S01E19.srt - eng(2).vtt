[Between Love and Frost]

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.020
[Episode 19]

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.100
No, something's wrong.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.380
Didn't expect this, did you?

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.220
You met Minghui

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.100
just two days ago,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.900
and here you are meeting again so soon.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.300
Try this.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.940
It's Minghui's specialty.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.580
It truly is an excellent dish.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.860
You passed the message to Gu Tongpei.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.100
That's how he caught Commander Liu.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.900
I did not.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.420
Look at how he treats me now.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.860
How could I possibly work with him?

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.780
You two exchange glances.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.980
Do you take me for blind?

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.100
You think Gu Tongpei
can really take me down?

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.940
Liu was just a petty Military Commander.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.260
Someone else can always take his place.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.060
I couldn't care less.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.180
Is that so? If you don't care,

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.300
why are you angry?

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.500
Chu Minghui,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.060
I thought after all these years

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.140
and all the lessons you've learned,

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.060
you would've grown wiser.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.860
But I never thought

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.660
you'd still be as foolish

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.540
as you were.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.260
You may not fear death.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.900
But don't forget

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.340
Hongdou only has one life.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.900
Don't you touch her!

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.140
Oh, really?

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.140
Chu Minghui,

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.820
my whole life

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.340
has been ruined by you two.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.180
You still dare hope for happiness

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.660
and think you can escape me?

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.860
Dream on!

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.740
If you truly care about Hongdou,

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.460
make sure you two play the roles

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.180
of my wife and daughter properly.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.180
Or else,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.940
I'll drag her

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.580
to the underground with me.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.900
Is the listening device set up?

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.740
Yesterday, the body of Commander Liu

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.100
was dredged from the moat.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.700
Covered with stab wounds.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.060
How did he die?

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.300
What exactly happened that night?

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.860
Commander Liu is dead?

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.180
That's so sudden.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.140
He went straight home after dinner.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.140
Chu Minghui, you're lying.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.660
Liu clearly died
inside the Military Governor's Mansion.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.180
He was Ce's trusted aide.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.020
No one throughout the whole mansion

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.180
had the reason to kill him.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.460
If you only asked me here

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.580
to talk about this,

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.700
I'm leaving.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.260
Are you hiding some hardship?

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.340
If you tell me,

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.180
I will help you.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.220
Gu Tongpei,

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.500
stop overthinking.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.100
I do not need your help.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.740
Stop making trouble for my husband.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.580
That's the greatest help
you can give me.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.100
Now you're playing affectionate?

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.100
Don't forget

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.980
my life was also ruined by you.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.500
Some things, once broken,

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.340
cannot be restored

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.900
no matter how you try.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.580
What if I say

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.140
I'm willing to give you a new life?

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.740
What you can give isn't what I want.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.660
Only Gu Tongce

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.260
can give me the life I want.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.620
[Jinghua Watch Shop]

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.700
Who are you?

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.100
What are you doing?

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:42.500
Don't...

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.380
Mr. Gu, we found it.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.180
It's opium. They're running
an opium business.

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.700
I had always found it strange.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.020
Gu Tongce has been
greasing palms for years.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.820
That must cost a lot of money.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:05.500
But we never managed to find out

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.420
what business he was in.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.100
Luckily, you mentioned this watch shop.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.740
Mr. Gu,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.420
how did you know
something was wrong here?

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.140
Some things, once broken,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.580
cannot be restored

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.580
no matter how you try.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.820
Someone gave it to me.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.780
Is it... Madam?

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.140
Mr. Gu,

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.140
I'm a direct person

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.020
and I speak plainly.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:43.940
Please don't mind.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.660
Four years ago, Madam entrusted me

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.420
to protect you at all costs.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.380
Now you've met her again.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.900
Commander Liu is dead.

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:52.180
Today's operation is sudden.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.900
We'll catch him red-handed.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.420
With such a grave crime
of opium trafficking,

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.500
Gu Tongce can hardly escape punishment,
even if not executed.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.100
We're getting closer and closer
to our goal.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.500
But you don't look happy.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.620
Opium trafficking is a capital crime.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.100
Keep them under strict watch.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.620
Be sure to trace the source.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.780
Yes, sir.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.060
Mr. Gu,

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:51.340
the opium flowing into Jiang City

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.300
is all distributed
through Jinghua Watch Shop.

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.660
And part of that money

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.540
went into the Inspector's pocket.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:02.620
No wonder when I wanted
to investigate this thoroughly,

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.820
the Inspector ignored it.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.180
So all these warlords
are cut from the same cloth.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:10.100
Forget it.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.780
Once we finish this,

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.340
we'll leave Jiang City for good.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:16.340
Then will all our effort this time
be wasted?

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:18.740
Not necessarily.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:32.580
Mr. Gu.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:34.780
Bad news.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.300
The Jinghua Watch Shop, our opium hub,

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.700
has been raided by Gu Tongpei.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.340
How could he have found that place?

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:44.140
I don't know, sir.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.140
Useless!

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.100
That was our biggest source of income.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.100
Tongpei,

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.140
I was just about to look for you.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.980
I've heard about the opium den.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:03.100
You're remarkably quick.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.780
You've only been back for a few days

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.620
and already handled a few major matters.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.380
I also came to discuss this.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.420
I pried out
quite a lot of useful information

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.980
from the ones I captured.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.020
I ask for your assistance

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.380
in rooting out the opium trade

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.020
in Jiang City.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:21.620
How dutiful you are.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.420
Of course, I'll give my full support.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.380
Fully cooperate to eradicate opium.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.180
Yes, sir.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:30.820
Tongpei,

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.580
I happen to have something
to ask for your help.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:36.140
Minghui has a follow-up
at the hospital this afternoon.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.300
I'm tied up with official duties
and can't get away.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.140
So please,

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.300
take her there.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:45.980
All right.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.580
Send people to kill Gu Tongpei.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.900
I want Chu Minghui

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.620
to watch him die right in front of her.

00:10:59.020 --> 00:10:59.820
Yes.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:05.580
Here.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:07.700
Is it good?

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.580
Yes, it's so sweet.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:11.860
You see?

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.980
This milk tastes better

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.340
with red beans in it, right?

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.580
Let's have another sip.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.300
Our Hongdou is the sweetest.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.180
If all this hadn't happened,

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.100
perhaps she and I

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.140
could have had a happy family.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.100
Uncle.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:39.540
Come on.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.700
You look so pretty today.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.460
Did your mother braid your hair?

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.620
Mother has the best hands.

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.340
Let me hold her.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.340
How heavy can this little dumpling be?

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.740
Hold her a bit longer,

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.820
and she won't let you go.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.940
Then I'll stay a bit longer.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.420
This little dumpling
can be clingy. Come here.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:06.180
I am not.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:22.820
Hongdou,

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.700
go out and play with yourself
for a while.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.620
I have something to say to your mother.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.140
Is that okay?

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.300
Go.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.620
The Jinghua Watch Shop has closed.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.020
What a pity.
Their watches looked pretty nice.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.900
Was this just a coincidence too?

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:44.780
What else?

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.500
Uncle, look.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.580
Mother lied last time.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.740
Father isn't in it.

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.180
It's just you.

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.980
It's just some old thing
I forgot to throw away.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.220
Here, you can take it back.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.940
Let's go, Hongdou.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:24.180
Anything

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:25.940
else?

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.020
I'm taking you to the hospital.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:34.020
[Cunji Hospital of Jiang City]

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:35.980
What's wrong with your body?

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:37.500
Why do you need regular check-ups?

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.420
Women who've given birth

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.340
are always left with some ailments.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.420
Chu Minghui,

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.580
you can lie to me about anything else,

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.620
but when it comes to your health,

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.380
I hope you don't.

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.700
I told you, I'm fine.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.300
Mind your own business.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.380
Hongdou is still waiting
for me at home.

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:05.540
I'm going back now.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.220
Take him to the doctor.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:59.140
Keep the rest for yourselves.

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:10.980
Pei!

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.780
I've missed you so much.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.820
Where have you been all these years?

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:17.780
Don't disappear so suddenly again.

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:19.980
I just saved your life.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.620
You'd better treat me to a good meal.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.140
Chu Yan,

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:24.780
why are you here?

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.340
I just happened to be passing by.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:28.980
Don't you think we're fated?

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.340
Mrs. Gu, it's been a while.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.940
I need to catch up with Pei.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.020
Wouldn't be convenient
if you followed.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.940
Okay, I'll leave you alone.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.900
I've got things to do. See you.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:48.780
Pei.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.060
I have something very important

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:51.940
to tell you.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.220
It's about my father.

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.330
It's the first time
you've brought me tea and snacks.

00:16:08.850 --> 00:16:09.660
You want anything?

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.620
Did you send the person

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.780
who tried to assassinate Gu Tongpei?

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.690
He's the Military Commissioner now.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:20.930
If you kill him,

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:22.300
the higher-ups will investigate.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:23.850
Doesn't he deserve to die?

00:16:24.970 --> 00:16:26.660
He's ruined my plans several times.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.140
He must die.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.090
Leave the things and you may go.
