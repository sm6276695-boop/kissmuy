Young Master,

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.679
Huo Beishan found me…

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:53.439
The…

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.520
The young lady you love…

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.640
Is her name Huo Qingwan?

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:06.120
Remember,

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:09.159
everyone in the Huo family

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:12.280
is our enemy.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.040
You can never be together…

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.319
Can we never be together, after all?

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:58.319
She was the only family
I had left in this world.

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.879
You can tell me her story.

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.680
You'll feel better.

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.759
She was my mother's maid.

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.560
They were like sisters.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.199
She took care of me

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.639
after my mother passed away.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.240
Young Master,

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:21.479
please bear with it.

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.520
Whenever I was mistreated
in the Huo family,

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.439
she was the one who stood by me.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.520
Only she never

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.240
forgot my mother.

She loved chestnuts,

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.039
so I buried her under a chestnut tree.

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.319
I'm sure

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.000
Madam Li will be happy to see it

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.159

and fall next year.

After tonight,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.839
no matter how hard it gets,
you have to hold it together.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.000
Governor can't find out.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.839
I don't know

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.079
what happened to your mother,

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.160
but you have
to pretend everything's normal

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.720
if you want to stay safe.

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:08.079
Don't push me away.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.150
You're the only one I have left.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.360
Huang Li is dead.

Liu Chengyin.

Weilian!

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:46.839
Weilian!

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.560
Weilian, I was wrong.

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:48.879
Please forgive me.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.160
Is this all because of Huo Qingwan?

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:54.639
Sheng Weilian!

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.519
You ruined me!

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.240
You can't abandon me!

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.680
Leave me alone!

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:11.660
You'll actually do whatever it takes

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:13.120
to get into the Sheng family, huh?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.279
I'll prove to you

00:07:15.839 --> 00:07:17.000
I'm better for you

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:18.639
than Huo Qingwan ever was.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.800
Then, I'll be waiting to see

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:26.120
just how worthy you are of my love.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.580
(Huo Residence)

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:48.360
Can't you tell me

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.319
who you really are?

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:54.759
Didn't you say

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.000
it didn't matter who I was?

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:03.480
I hate the Huo family.

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:05.360
But I think

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.519
you're different from the rest of them.

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:09.839
Maybe you and I

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:11.839
are alike in some ways.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.279
I used to want

00:08:20.279 --> 00:08:21.480
to do one thing above all else.

00:08:23.279 --> 00:08:24.319
But now I realize

00:08:25.519 --> 00:08:26.199
that thing

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.399
could cost me what matters most.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.759
Do you think
I should go through with it?

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.519
If it's something

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:43.480
that has to be done, then you must accept
losing what matters to you.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.240
Hurry up!

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.520
Be careful.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:56.840
Cui.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:58.970
Why are you moving all these things?

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.650
Governor wants
the warehouse demolished.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.360
Miss, don't go over there.

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:06.600
Someone died here.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.360
It's haunted.

00:09:07.919 --> 00:09:08.759
Someone died here?

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:20.840
Qingwan,

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.159
Uncle wants us to have lunch together.

00:09:23.279 --> 00:09:24.480
You should get changed.
