00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:14.125
Don't move.

00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:19.666
Speak quickly.

00:01:20.583 --> 00:01:21.833
Where is the explosive hidden?

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:23.125
I don't know.

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:24.583
I really don't know.

00:01:25.458 --> 00:01:26.375
Let me tell you.

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.541
If the factory is destroyed,

00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:29.875
the workers will lose their jobs.

00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:31.500
the whole city will be plunged into darkness.

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:33.500
It’s the ordinary people who will suffer.

00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:35.791
Then bandits will run rampant.

00:01:36.708 --> 00:01:38.125
Women and children will be bullied.

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:40.250
You're helping the wrongdoers.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.041
Do you understand?

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:43.416
I'm just a junior guard.

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:45.125
How would I know all this?

00:01:46.375 --> 00:01:46.750
Jiaqi.

00:01:49.416 --> 00:01:50.291
Listen to me carefully.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.791
If you still have any conscience as a Chinese,

00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:56.666
tell us where the explosives are hidden.

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.000
We can spare your life.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:59.250
Explosives.

00:02:01.916 --> 00:02:02.458
The explosives are over there.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.708
You two, come and check.

00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:09.833
Jiaqi.

00:02:19.666 --> 00:02:20.291
Here.

00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:22.458
Scissors.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.041
Be careful.

00:02:57.083 --> 00:02:59.833
Do you know why we buried the explosives?

00:03:01.958 --> 00:03:03.166
Just in case.

00:03:04.458 --> 00:03:05.500
Orders from above.

00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:08.083
If the Communist forces cross the river,

00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:10.166
blow up the power plant.

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:12.750
Don’t leave the Communist bandits

00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.541
even a trace of light.

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:17.541
The workers seem to have been influenced.

00:03:17.875 --> 00:03:18.791
They're hard to deal with.

00:03:21.083 --> 00:03:22.208
If persuasion doesn't work,

00:03:22.416 --> 00:03:23.458
we'll use force.

00:03:24.416 --> 00:03:25.458
If we can't blow up everything,

00:03:26.541 --> 00:03:27.625
then destroy part of it.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:29.208
Which part should we blow up?

00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:32.083
The key components of the power plant

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.916
are the boiler,

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:35.750
the turbine,

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:37.750
the circulation pump,

00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:40.000
and the generator.

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:43.166
Destroy any one of them,

00:03:44.208 --> 00:03:45.125
and the Communist forces

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.750
will face

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.833
a pitch-dark Nanjing.

00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:55.625
First, break the workers' spirit.

00:03:57.458 --> 00:03:58.500
Clear the way.

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:04.375
It's up to you now.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.625
Hurry up.

00:04:20.916 --> 00:04:21.291
Move quickly.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.875
Go.

00:04:26.208 --> 00:04:26.791
What are you looking at?

00:04:29.625 --> 00:04:30.041
Move.

00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:33.750
It seems

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.375
we can't avoid today's fight.

00:04:38.041 --> 00:04:39.625
If we don't teach the Bureau a lesson,

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:41.750
the other factories will be at a disadvantage.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.500
Let's settle it here.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.875
I'm innocent, please let me go.

00:04:48.125 --> 00:04:49.250
You're innocent?

00:04:50.208 --> 00:04:52.250
We're the ones who got screwed by you.

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:53.333
I don't know anything.

00:04:53.458 --> 00:04:54.958
Why did you tie me up?

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.125
You know nothing?

00:04:56.333 --> 00:04:57.583
You think I'm stupid?

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.083
Who did it?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.750
Speak.

00:05:25.083 --> 00:05:25.791
Where did it come from?

00:05:25.916 --> 00:05:26.416
I don't know.

00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:31.541
You.

00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:33.166
Are you going to talk or not?

00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:38.958
We swear we really don't know.

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:51.458
You guys,

00:05:52.166 --> 00:05:53.250
who's in charge?

00:05:56.541 --> 00:05:57.375
Speak up.

00:05:57.666 --> 00:05:58.333
What's going on?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.125
Explosives in the factory—

00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:01.375
what are you trying to do?

00:06:20.875 --> 00:06:21.958
Miss Xia.

00:06:42.916 --> 00:06:43.916
I didn't expect

00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:47.666
we'd meet again like this.

00:06:50.833 --> 00:06:51.625
Miss Xia.

00:06:52.458 --> 00:06:53.541
Hope you've been well.

00:06:54.583 --> 00:06:56.166
You knew from the very beginning.

00:06:58.958 --> 00:07:00.333
Ever since I got off the train,

00:07:01.708 --> 00:07:02.916
you've been following me.

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.291
Then why didn't you act sooner?

00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:15.208
Actually,

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:17.958
being a university professor really suits you.

00:07:26.708 --> 00:07:27.625
Then why did you

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.916
not act sooner?

00:07:33.583 --> 00:07:34.791
Anyone who dares to sabotage the factory

00:07:37.291 --> 00:07:38.875
is taking away the workers' livelihoods.

00:07:40.166 --> 00:07:41.500
Anyone who opposes the workers

00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:44.166
is opposing the people.

00:07:46.458 --> 00:07:47.208
The people

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:48.583
will never accept that.

00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:58.125
I'm asking you,

00:07:58.333 --> 00:07:59.750
why didn't you act earlier?

00:08:39.541 --> 00:08:40.291
Miss Xia

00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:41.541
Miss Xia

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.750
Miss Xia

00:08:49.875 --> 00:08:50.416
Miss Xia

00:09:15.291 --> 00:09:15.833
Miss Xia

00:09:16.458 --> 00:09:16.875
Miss Xia

00:10:18.583 --> 00:10:18.916
Chase!

00:10:19.041 --> 00:10:19.375
After them!
