=Spring Fever=
=Episode 5=

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.200
(Father, where are you going?
Don't abandon me!)

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.920
(Father, don't leave! Father!)

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.160
(Princess He'an died
giving birth to the Young Lord.)

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.920
(His birth caused her death.)

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.480
(I'm setting off on my cultivation path.
Take good care of the Young Lord.)

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.520
(Mother,)

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.160
(all my life, I believed)

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.320
(you died while giving birth to me.)

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.920
(But that accusation letter claims)

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.480
(your death wasn't an accident.)

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.840
(This time, I've come)

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.360
(to uncover the truth.)

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.880
Shi'an,

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.872
your mother's life remains at stake.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.000
Aren't you concerned?

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.720
Jin is truly unharmed.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.600
Take this potion.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.600
I'll take you to her.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.080
Potion?

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.040
What kind of potion?

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.800
It's the sterility potion.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.960
Your failed lamp offering,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.048
angering the deities
and causing Jinzhi's miscarriage.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.240
She may never conceive again.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.280
This cannot escape family rules.
I couldn't ignore it.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.880
Lord Shen already proved
my innocence that day.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.520
And I offered her a way to save face.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.680
Yet in the end,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.600
the one who doubts me

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.680
turns out to be you.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.960
I do believe you, but...

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.240
What?

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.560
Mother.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.240
Mother.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.120
What are you doing?

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.720
Let me go!

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.160
Shi'an.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.560
A'man.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.280
Let me go!

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.400
Be gentle with her!

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.280
Let me go!

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.840
What?

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:59.560
Hurry, Shi'an!

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.240
Let me go!

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.960
Hurry, Shi'an!

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.200
Do it now!

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.000
Shi'an.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.320
My life remains in her hands.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.040
Shi'an.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.000
A'man.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.840
Shi'an.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.560
We already have Jin.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.920
Even if you never conceive,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.040
I'll protect you both.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.920
(I'm sorry.)

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.920
(Beat me or curse me
after taking it. I'll accept it all.)

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.480
I'm sorry.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.400
A'man.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.800
A'man.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.160
Jinzhi promised

00:02:53.696 --> 00:02:55.200
that as long as you never conceive,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.640
she'll stop tormenting you.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.680
Is this what you meant

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.320
by treating me well?

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:10.840
I had no choice.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.280
You always have choices.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.720
You just never choose me.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.560
It's just that

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.920
when trouble comes,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.080
you always discard me.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.680
That's not true.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:29.320
A'man.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.920
A'man.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.760
A'man, what's wrong?

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.240
A'man.

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.320
A'man, what's happening?

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.000
A'man.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.640
A'man, what's happening?

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.960
A'man.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.720
A'man.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.600
W-What's happening?

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.560
A'man, what's wrong?

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.720
A'man.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.080
A'man!

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.320
A'man!

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.960
A'man!

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.880
Get the physician!

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.680
Hurry, get the physician!

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.080
Wait. Wasn't it a sterility potion?

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.760
A'man.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.920
She's been poisoned.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.160
She's dead.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.600
Bury her.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:12.560
You lied.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.760
You lied!

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.560
Why?

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.320
Why did you kill her?

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.120
I killed her?

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.600
What have I done?

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.480
Wasn't it you who fed her the potion?

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.240
You...

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.160
I'll get the physician.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.360
Mother, watch over her.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.280
It's too late.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.200
And if this gets out,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.400
you will be the murderer, not me.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.840
Now that I'm satisfied.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.480
Your mother will remain unharmed.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.800
The funds your mother embezzled...

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.200
I've reimbursed them with my dowry.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.040
Shi'an,

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.080
Concubine Ye has...

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.520
She's already... Just bury her, okay?

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.760
Shi'an.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.000
Shi'an.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.560
What are you doing?

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.560
Don't you keep
having the same nightmare?

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.720
I tell the nightmare
to this brocade box.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.880
Lock it inside and bury it.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.320
Then you'll never
have the same nightmare again.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.320
Really?

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.040
Yes.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.640
My grandmother taught me that. It works.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.720
Well...

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.520
I'll trust you for now.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.680
A'man,

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.040
whenever you're sad

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.040
scared,

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.720
or in danger, just tell me.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:31.920
I'll protect you.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.120
Always.

00:05:35.936 --> 00:05:37.720
♪Wine like steel, steel with wine♪

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.240
Okay.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.560
Shi'an.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.080
Shi'an.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.000
Shi'an.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.920
Shi'an.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.280
I'll bury it then.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.120
Bury it.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.680
Bury it all.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.280
Mother.

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.400
Mother.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.280
Mother.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:07.920
Mother.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.440
Mother.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.440
Wake up.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.560
Wake up, please.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.720
Jin.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.256
A penal slave begets a criminal slave.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.680
Take them and sell them off.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:26.960
Mother.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:29.640
Jin.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.920
She's not a criminal slave.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.520
She's not my daughter.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.480
Mother.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.680
She's not a criminal slave.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.080
Let her go!

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.440
Jin.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.000
Mother.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Jin.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:54.240
Mother.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.880
Jin.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.800
(How am I still alive?)

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.240
(Where am I?)

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.120
I can't die.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.920
I can't die.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.640
(I can't die.)

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.360
(Can't die...)

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.720
What?

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.960
Reluctant to come out?

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.920
How do you know I am here?

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.560
You're a crucial lead
in my investigation.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.760
I know

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.560
your every move.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.920
Jin isn't with Xia Jinzhi.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.800
The potion Lu Shi'an gave me
was poisoned.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.880
You knew all this.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.840
Did you come to mock me?

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.160
I told you before.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.440
You

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.920
won't yield until you hit the end.

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.072
Under the guise of drug primer,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.440
Xia Jinzhi's maid

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.920
purchased arsenic
from several pharmacies.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.160
The potion Lu Shi'an gave you

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:34.560
was originally poisoned.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.600
I swapped it.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.040
I'm your savior.

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.400
Is this how you treat me?

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.720
Watching me drown in misery,

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.120
while you stand by idly.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.040
If you enjoy spectacles so much,

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.000
why bother saving me at all?

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.560
You're heartless.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.200
You're meddlesome.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.640
Self-righteous!

00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.760
Opportunistic!

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.120
Cruel!

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.400
Despicable!

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.760
Stupid.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:14.960
Stupid?

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:18.480
Yes.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.480
I'm stupid.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.800
Stupid enough to be sheltered
by the Lu family all these years

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.680
and meekly endured everything.

00:10:26.368 --> 00:10:28.440
Stupid enough to believe
that even though Lu Shi'an

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.600
didn't register me
under civilian registration,

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.080
he'd take good care of Jin.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.720
Stupid enough to follow him knowingly

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.600
into this trap,

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.520
trying to prove he hadn't deceived me.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.320
Stupid enough to believe
sincerity begets sincerity.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.840
Yet in this world,
sincerity is the cheapest commodity.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:24.200
I'm sorry.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.360
Just now,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.080
I shouldn't have

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.840
spoken to you that way.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.640
You were right.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.840
I was deluded.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.200
Being scolded into awareness is better.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.320
Some people

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.600
never wake up

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.640
before they die.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.040
Come on.

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.560
To survival.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:06.480
Come on.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.040
To survival.

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.000
Gao Fu.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.400
My lord.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.440
The fire seems not strong enough.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.720
Fetch more firewood.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.560
This fire's strong. Enough firewood.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.200
There is plenty.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:34.680
Not enough.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.160
Alright then.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.000
Lord Shen,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.760
I accept the partnership

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.040
you proposed earlier.

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.760
Let's make a deal.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.480
I'll protect you and your daughter
from mistreatment in the Lu family.

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.040
And you tell me

00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.080
everything you know about the Lu family

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:01.088
and Ningzhou Prefecture.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.080
How do I know your intentions?

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.240
Why should I trust you?

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.880
They treated you so poorly.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.800
Yet you still care
about their interests?

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.440
You can't truly love
that spineless man, right?

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.440
Listen.

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.200
The Lu family took me in,
for better or worse.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.920
Shi'an might be weak,
but he's my daughter's father.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.720
You're just an outsider.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.800
Why should I trust you?

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.200
Xia Jinzhi will never conceive again.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.000
What do you mean?

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.320
Nothing specific.

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.800
Just testing if any affection remains

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.840
between you and Lu Shi'an.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.280
What do you think?

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.120
Some remains.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:47.880
But not much.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.080
Fine. When you regret this,

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.520
come find me.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:58.920
Okay.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.200
So,

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.360
what are you going to do next?

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.496
Return to the Lu family.
