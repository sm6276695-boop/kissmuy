00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.350
Thank you.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.800
Lately,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.630
Has your wife been feeling better?

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.870
About the same.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.120
But

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.590
she's getting better day by day.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.710
Given the current situation, it shouldn't be long now.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.000
She should recover soon.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.120
Report.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.590
Do you know this person?

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.630
Him?

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.680
I've met him twice.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.280
We just started interacting.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.470
The newly established Jinling Fuhai Machinery Factory.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.800
He's a businessman.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.520
Polite and refined.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.400
Very active socially.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.030
There have been frequent incidents lately.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.960
The Communist agent Flying Dragon

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.750
has already infiltrated Nanjing.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.030
We must find him as soon as possible.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.030
Are you saying

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.910
he is Flying Dragon?

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.750
I can't be sure yet.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.120
But he's definitely connected.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.190
The word "enemy"

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.710
is never written on one's face.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.430
You have to coexist

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.080
to tell good from bad.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.750
Only through confrontation

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.870
can you distinguish friend from foe.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.870
Understood.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.920
Keep a close watch on him.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:17.750
Yes.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.120
Follow them.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.390
Little girl, you must be hungry.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.600
Here.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.750
Take this. Hurry, eat well.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.750
Boss, I haven't eaten in days.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.510
Please give me something to eat.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.720
I haven't eaten either! Why should you eat? Get lost!

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:10.190
Auntie, could you give me some food?

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.040
No. Go as far away as you can.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.040
Go.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.270
Go on.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.190
Here.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:26.800
Eat.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.240
Jiaqi,

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.510
Recently, they've moved all the experts to Shanghai and Guangzhou,

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:02.720
and to Hong Kong, China and Taiwan, China.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:04.480
Has this affected you?

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.430
As for me,

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.560
it hasn't made much difference.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.070
But with all the experts gone,

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.430
what will happen to Nanjing in the future?

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.240
What can we do?

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.040
They're relocating experts from every field in large numbers.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.240
They're not leaving anything for our Party.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:27.630
That's not acceptable.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.480
These people must stay.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.150
For building the new government,

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:33.720
they are a vital force.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.720
Come in.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:42.960
Oh,

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:44.750
Teacher Xia,

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.390
what brings you here?

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.030
Boss Zhao,

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.200
this factory is truly impressive.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.320
Such grandeur,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.200
it's admirable.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.270
Let me introduce you.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.910
This is Teacher Xia from Jinling Women's University.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:57.550
Nice to meet you.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.750
And this is Director Zhang from the Second Department of the Ministry of Transport.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:02.270
Hello, Director Zhang.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.720
Sorry for dropping by unexpectedly.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.240
I hope I'm not interrupting your work.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:08.240
Not at all.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.390
A beautiful lady visiting us—

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:10.600
we're more than happy to welcome you.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:11.030
Absolutely.

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.390
Please,

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:11.870
have a seat.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.440
Please, sit down.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.150
Jiaqi and I

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.440
were just chatting idly.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.600
Given the current situation,

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.960
factories in Nanjing

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.270
are either closing down or shutting their doors.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.000
Boss Zhao running a business at this time

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:27.960
shows real courage.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.080
Today,

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.150
I came here especially to learn from you.

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.750
Business is tough these days.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:35.870
So I'm trying out a factory first.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.120
If things go well,

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.200
I might even make some money.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:39.550
Just trying my luck.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:49.910
Teacher Xia,

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:51.200
Teacher Xia,

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.750
look—

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.270
Boss Zhao looks so confident.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:00.670
This factory

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:02.270
definitely has great potential.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.080
It's hard to do business nowadays.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.600
No workers when you need them,

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:07.790
and no technology either.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:08.870
There's no technical expertise.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.030
How can that be?

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.270
The Nationalist government is sending top talent

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.630
to the south for protection.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.910
Now, experts in Nanjing

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.390
are getting fewer and fewer.

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:24.630
No wonder.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.870
Several professors from our university have left too.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.480
In fact,

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.720
my teacher and their family are leaving tomorrow.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.720
I'm going to the station to see them off.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:37.200
So, you two came here

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.270
to discuss work?

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:40.510
Besides, your experts and professors

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:42.270
have nothing to do with my factory.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:44.670
That's true.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:45.270
Yes.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.750
Let's just take a look at your factory.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:49.000
Alright.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:49.910
This way, please.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.240
After you.

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:02.240
This Ms. Xia

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.320
Did you know her before?

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.000
I've met her.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.910
But I wouldn't say I know her.

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.510
So why did she suddenly come to the factory today?

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.750
I'm puzzled too.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:15.200
This matter

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.510
is indeed a bit strange.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:21.790
She was at our factory,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.120
looking around very carefully.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.440
She kept asking about what products we make.

00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:30.480
I suspect Ms. Xia's identity.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.240
There's definitely something off about her.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.630
Makes sense.

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:37.480
We should be cautious.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:40.550
Oh, right.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.510
She mentioned the experts will be relocated tomorrow.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.550
Can we trust this?

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:46.150
Boss.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:47.870
Boss.

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:50.670
She mentioned the experts will be relocated tomorrow.

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:51.550
Can we trust this?

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:52.550
You brat,

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.150
can't you think for yourself?

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.240
I...
