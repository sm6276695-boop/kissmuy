[Episode 3]

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.710
Glad to meet you, Tongpei.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.950
Likewise, Minghui.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.790
Pei,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.040
Minghui

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.280
came to our city to do grain business.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.280
She'll be a great help to our army.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.760
You two should keep in touch.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.070
Sure, Mr. Gu.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.150
Father,

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.870
let's go have dinner.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.350
Minghui has been busy all day

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.280
and hasn't eaten yet.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.480
Okay.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.150
Let's go for dinner.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.920
I'm not hungry.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.790
Let's go.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.510
Are you okay?

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.560
Excuse me.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.030
Did you see

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.240
anyone pass by

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.470
just now?

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.910
Seize the chance.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.240
Don't let me down.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.310
Right here?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.590
You really think highly of me.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Once it's done,

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.800
I'll make sure you leave safely.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.800
Minghui, you look pale.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.310
Did you not sleep well?

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.150
You don't look too well either.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.150
Poor sleep?

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.030
I'm in my own home.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.430
How could I not sleep well?

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:28.680
Tongpei,

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.380
what's the story with your new girl?

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.430
She's bold.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.520
Just...

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.240
a wild kitten.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.190
A wild kitten.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.120
Enjoy.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.710
I need to go.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.310
Get along well,

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.190
you two.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.710
Tongpei,

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.240
the drawer in my dressing table
is broken.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.080
I'm wondering

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.000
if you can help me fix it.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.800
Sure.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.380
Thanks so much for your help.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.870
Would you want

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.190
any reward?

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:33.480
It's nothing.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.040
There's no need.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.160
Were you

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.120
peeking at me?

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.600
You seem to have no sense of boundaries.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.160
Tongpei,

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.270
we are family.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.600
And this is your reward?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Are you okay?

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.040
Who are you?

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:22.680
Why do you want to kill me?

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.720
Do you ask every assassin

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.040
their reason to kill you?

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.800
Lots of people want me dead.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.060
But you are the only one

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.920
who dares to make a move here.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.830
Thanks for the compliment.

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.270
Miss Chu,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.870
is the Second Young Master with you?

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:48.600
Minghui,

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.480
things in your room look fragile.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.240
I'll keep an eye on them

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.800
and help you fix them anytime.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:56.920
Mr. Gu,

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.680
Miss Chu Yan is here.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.000
She's waiting in the parlor.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.190
Okay.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.120
Minghui, come along and meet her.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:07.270
Sure.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.270
Where's Chu Yan?

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.670
Pei,

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.440
I missed you so much.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.510
Pei.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.780
[Chu Yan]

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.390
Did you miss me?

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.670
This is...

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.320
This is

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.080
Chu Minghui,,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.840
my sister-in-law.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.000
Oh, Miss Chu.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.390
You surely have good romantic luck.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.000
Hello, pretty.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.390
Pei,

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.320
my father's away on business,

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.440
and no one's at home.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.360
I'll stay here

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.440
tonight.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:26.600
Suit yourself.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.000
I brought you a present.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.120
Lan, bring it over.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.440
Sorry, Miss Chu.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.600
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.790
It's okay.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:46.510
Leave it.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.510
She's too clumsy.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.840
I'll take care of her.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:01.870
You're truly kind-hearted,

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:03.200
though

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:04.360
there's no need

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.840
to care so much about a maid.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.670
I need to ask you something.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:12.840
I'm busy. Another day.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.630
Lan,

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:26.910
does your hand still hurt?

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.870
It's okay,

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.910
Miss Chu.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.120
I can't believe you flirted with Pei

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.670
right in front of me.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.270
How dare you?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.630
That Chu Minghui

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.510
also flirted with Pei
right before my eyes.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.000
Go and get something for me.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.080
I want a snake.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.080
Is she the one who saved me?

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:15.960
Morning.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.080
I've made fresh soup.

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.360
Have a try.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.200
Snake soup needs to be drunk warm.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.030
It's nourishing.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.390
Yesterday,

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.320
a good one gave me a gift.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.870
How did she know

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.030
since childhood, I've always been best

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.440
at making snake soup?

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.300
I always

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.740
repay favors.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.120
I will find her

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.240
and thank her

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.100
with a good gift.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.000
Try it.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.630
I have things to do.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:54.600
I'll see you.

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:55.980
You're not having it?

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:00.670
Little girl.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.720
Have some snake soup. It's nourishing.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.670
Good timing.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.320
Snake soup. It's nourishing.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.750
Your skills

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.080
aren't those of a trader.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.840
What's your background really?

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.000
Curious?

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:39.820
Well,

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:41.340
find me at the dance hall today.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.220
Catch me in good spirits and I'll talk.

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:47.660

Minghui, it's loud here.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:38.220
Not the place

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.220
for sincere talk.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.940
I'm sending you on your way.

A bit of bustle is only fitting.

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.700
There's a time and place to kill.

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:04.540
Don't hurt the innocent.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:06.500
Rest assured,

Apologies.

Do you have any last words?

I don't think I'm ready

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.020
to die young just yet.
