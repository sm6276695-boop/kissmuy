00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.640
Let me go!

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.400
Let me go!

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.120
Let me go!

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.760
Let me go!

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.040
Let me go!

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.560
Mother.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.080
Mother, don't do this.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.000
Please cooperate.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.840
Immortal Song is performing an exorcism.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.600
It's been over a decade.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.600
Why haven't you reincarnated yet?

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.240
I didn't harm you.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.640
You were carrying a child.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.520
I would never hurt you.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.320
Big-headed ghost.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.320
Big-headed ghost!

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.600
Wicked woman!

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.560
Release her.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.120
With me here,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.920
the entity possessing her
won't dare act recklessly.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.320
It actually worked.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.680
Indeed. How impressive.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.680
The mouth spews sacred water.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.720
The eyes radiate solar brilliance.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.520
Celestial guardians capture spirits.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.840
Vajra deities purge ailments.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.600
By this sacred decree,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.160
reveal the truth in detail.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.000
Immortal Song,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.680
how's everything going?

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.160
The spectral gate opens
at the southeastern chastity arch.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.520
The spectral disturbance
stems from the Lu residence.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.960
A low-status woman in this household

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.360
must have dallied with a noble.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.120
She violated feminine virtues,
disrupting moral order,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.960
causing this chaos.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.640
If it isn't properly resolved,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.280
Ningzhou will never know peace.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.560
Violating feminine virtues?

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.080
Who is it?

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.080
I know who it is.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.360
Stop your baseless accusations.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.520
Immortal Song, please enlighten us.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.680
Who exactly is this concubine?

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.960
Don't make us commoners speculate wildly

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.720
and wrong innocent people.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.800
The Prefect
considers matters thoroughly.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.320
With my aged and ailing body,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.880
I'll invite deities to reveal the truth.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.160
Who's there?

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.760
How dare you damage sacred objects!

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.880
I'm sorry.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.320
It slipped.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.000
It's her!

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.640
Just as the Zhang family's
chaste widow from West District,

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.800
you must collect the rootless water
to clean the chastity arch.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.440
If you're innocent,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.880
heaven will send sufficient rain

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.480
and manifest divine signs.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.680
This is absurd!

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.960
Lord Shen, please don't be angry.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.720
You may not know this.

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.320
Concubine Ye

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.120
must do as Widow Zhang did before,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.960
walking the main street
and collecting rainwater

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.520
to clean the chastity arch.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.160
If miracles appear on the arch,

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.040
it proves her innocence.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.720
This is Ningzhou's
longstanding tradition.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.560
Lord Shen, you should
refrain from interfering.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.240
You hold blind faith in spirits

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.320
and disregard human life.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.960
Have you found your faith

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.480
or become possessed?

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.760
Get up.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.080
Let's go.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.000
My lord, don't intervene.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.040
If you interfere,

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.000
you'll confirm you're the nobleman
I had an affair with.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.960
My innocence
will become harder to prove.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.016
So what if there's an affair?

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.760
I'll just take you back to the capital.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.800
Mind your words, my lord.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.520
Your words will only
get me killed by gossip.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.680
I'm willing

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.520
to collect the rootless water

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.000
to prove my innocence.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.760
I swear

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.040
that besides Lu Shi'an,

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.240
I've never had improper relations
with any man.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.120
Not in the past,

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.600
nor in the present.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.360
Fine.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.240
I won't interfere.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.000
(Sorry, Lord Shen.)

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.880
(I have my own plan.)

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.640
The sun's blazing. Rain is impossible.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.360
This is heaven punishing her.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.440
Exactly.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:25.760
(Jin.)

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.960
(Soon, I'll bring you back to my side.)

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.040
(All these years,
I thought pushing you away)

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.360
(and sending you
into Xia Jinzhi's chamber)

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.160
(would keep you safe from harm.)

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.680
(I was wrong.)

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.600
(I must bring you back to me.)

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.680
(No matter who I use,
no matter the cost.)

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.640
(In Ningzhou, everyone blindly believes
in divine will.)

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.520
(The Lu family parrots
morality and virtue.)

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.080
(Very well.
I'll play this farce with you.)

Who's shading her?

How dare they defy Immortal Song
to protect this evil woman?

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.160
Are they crazy?

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.680
Exactly!

My lord,

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.760
your blatant favoritism is astonishing.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.240
Aren't you worried about scandal?

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.600
I just wanted to drink tea,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.544

What's the problem?

So you just
blocked off the entire street?

Well, well.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.440

Wherever you drink,

you raise shade for her.

My lord,

if you truly fancy her,

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.080
I could help fulfill your desires,

Wouldn't that be ideal?

Are you rushing to expel me,

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.600

00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.600
My lord,

you're still young

Let me impart some wisdom.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.680
(But if no one comes,)

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.320

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.440
I wouldn't make you suffer.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.720
Nor would I hide it.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.840
Doesn't this seem odd?

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.720
This doesn't feel like
Xia Jinzhi's work.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:40.880
Could it be

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.600
that due to the ghost incident,

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.440
the mastermind

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.560
is trying to test you?

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.880
So this whole act was intentional?

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.280
You will not hide things from me,

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.440
yet I've kept secrets.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.920
I'm sorry, my lord.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.480
My lord.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:01.680
A'man,

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.320
how are you?

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.456
Let me take you home.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.440
I must wait for the divine signs
to manifest first.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.680
You come at the right time.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.000
How could there be a divine sign?

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.440
You've come

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.160
and the divine sign follows.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.200
Otherwise, Lord Shen's mere presence

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.280
won't convince others.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.920
Lu Shi'an,

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.600
you must tell them

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.320
this is the divine sign.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.600
(Lord Gao predicted
tonight's heavy rain accurately.)

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.880
(The red phosphorus
hidden in the calligraphy also worked.)

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.200
(Everything rests on tomorrow.)

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.280
Go back and recount
every detail to them.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.320
This is the divine sign.
