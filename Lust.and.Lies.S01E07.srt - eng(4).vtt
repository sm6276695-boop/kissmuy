=Lust and Lies=

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:56.280
Zhao Xun?

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:57.439
Why are you here?

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.039
I wanted to kill Huo Beishan,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.960
so you wouldn't have to
risk staying here.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.039
Go to my room.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.280
It's the safest place.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.480
Huo Beishan suspects me now.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.519
He'll search for me outside.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.680
He won't check my room.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.190
Let's go.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.719
How's your leg?

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:16.680
Being lame

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:18.959
makes them let down their guard.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.159
The one I killed
was Huo Beishan's scapegoat.

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:23.359
Also, he has powerful bodyguards.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.439
If we want to kill him,

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:27.719
it'll take a long plan.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.879
By the way,

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.120
have you found

00:01:32.519 --> 00:01:33.120
the Lion Seal?

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.040
The situation here is complicated.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:36.760
I need to

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.799
secure my footing first.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.480
No rush.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.200
Keep yourself safe.

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.000
With that cargo,

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:45.239
we have the upper hand.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.000
Zhao Xun,

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.480
the cargo could attract attention.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.959
We must destroy it quickly.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.599
What should we do with it?

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:58.040
If we stick to the plan,

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:59.560
the priority now is

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.239
to get you out of here.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.240
Zhao Xun.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.960
Zhao Xun.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:42.900
=Episode 7=

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:02.759
Huo Qingwan?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.319
I've underestimated you.

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.199
Not only did you hook up
with Huo Xiu and Sheng Weilian,

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:11.960
but now you've even brought
a man from outside.

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:13.879
It's not what you think.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.479
When I struggled to get by,

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:17.680
he helped me.

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.680
So when he ran into trouble,

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:21.879
I helped him too.

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:23.599
Using the Huo family's money?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.879
This is my money.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.830
If you don't believe me,
look for yourself.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.680
It's not Huo family money, is it?

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.840
Hurry and leave.

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:40.479
If Father finds you,

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.199
he'll treat you as bandits
and have you arrested.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.520
Leave now.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.719
Thank you.

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:54.240
You defended me last time.

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:55.479
This time,

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:56.800
we're even.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.639
I don't want to owe you.

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:01.240
All right.

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:03.240
You lot,

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.039
check the back area.

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.479
Yes, sir.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.840
Yes, sir.

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:14.240
Father.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.319
Governor.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.879
Who's that man?

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.800
Governor,

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.600
please spare him.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.240
He only came here

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:27.639
to see me.

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:38.759
Jin can vouch for me.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.040
She wants you to testify for her.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.240
I did see her with a man

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.240
by the back gate.

00:04:57.348 --> 00:04:58.120
But I think

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.480
the man is her lover.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.920
Because

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:07.000
they were hugging each other.

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:08.040
They looked intimate.

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:09.439
Besides,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.240
she even gave him money.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.519
Oh, right.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.680
That man is missing
his index and middle fingers.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.680
He's not like the assassin.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.639
He can't fire a gun.

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:21.759
Are you sure?

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:25.439
Mother says

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.279
she was with her

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:27.199
the whole night.

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:28.560
So I think

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.759
this assassination

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:31.079
has nothing to do with her.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.040
I'll do Madam this favor.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:45.399
But don't forget

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.000
this is the Huo Residence.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.480
You should cut ties

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:50.160
with the past.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.360
Thank you, Governor.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.319
Lover?

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:20.160
Yes.

00:06:30.298 --> 00:06:33.898
(Huo Residence)

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:41.519
Xiu,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.480
are you really going
to keep watching me?

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.639
Governor said

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:47.700
whoever visits the Huo Residence
these days

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.240
must be watched.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.800
Are you here to guard me

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.120
or watch me?

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.040
Miss Huo,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.480
before we make your outfit,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.680
I need to take your measurements.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.040
Sure.

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:16.000
I'll do it.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:41.839
Xiu,

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:44.160
why are your ears so red?

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:47.600
I...

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.240
I'm fine.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.720
I'll go outside.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.199
How's Zhao Xun?

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:04.560
He's fine.

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:05.800
Boss Ruan punished him

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:07.360
and prepared a corpse

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.800
to pose as the assassin.

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:11.720
The Huo Army should've found
that body by now.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.480
Huo Beishan

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.720
isn't easily fooled.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.879
Boss Ruan said

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:17.920
the body

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:19.600
would convince Huo Beishan.

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:21.639
Who is that?

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.120
Huo Beishan's enemies

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.120
are far too many.

00:08:28.879 --> 00:08:29.399
Miss Ruan,

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:30.959
this is

00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:32.440
the route map we planned.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.200
Miss Huo,

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:39.480
Mr. Sheng has arrived.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.080
Your leg's recovered?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.240
After resting for a few days,

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:58.200
I'm almost well.

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:01.679
These are your favorite cookies.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.080
I don't like them anymore.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.879
Can you not be so cold to me?

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.480
Let's go,

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:09.159
Mr. Sheng.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.320
The wound matches the one
from that night.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.399
This should be the assassin.

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:32.919
These rats

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.679
are really hard to shake off.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.159
These people...

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:42.720
It must be them

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:44.120
who raided the ship.

00:09:44.759 --> 00:09:46.799
The temple fair is about to start.

00:09:47.639 --> 00:09:49.279
We must catch them.

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:04.240
If Governor finds out that you leave your post,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.320
you'll get a beating.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.120
It's my business.

00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:09.120
Do what I say.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.399
Delay the action until after
the silver-throwing ceremony.

00:10:13.159 --> 00:10:15.159
Mr. Sheng won't take her away.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.159
Why are you so impatient?

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:18.919
Get out now.

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:24.159
Get out.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.039
Fine.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.279
I can't be bothered.

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:47.519
I didn't expect

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.320
Sucheng to be so lively at night.

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:51.960
Do you want a sachet?

00:10:56.679 --> 00:10:57.320
To be honest,

00:10:57.919 --> 00:10:58.840
I've always wanted

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.679
to take you to the temple fair

00:11:00.879 --> 00:11:01.840
like an ordinary couple...

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:04.159
You have good taste.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:05.840
Of course.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:06.679
I...

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:11.279
Since you know what to do,

00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:13.039
let's not waste words.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.120
