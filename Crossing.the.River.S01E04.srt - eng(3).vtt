00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:51.416
Awesome.

00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:52.666
In our Wang family,

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:54.166
we're about to have a pianist.

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:56.125
Why are you

00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:57.291
pulling such a long face?

00:01:57.916 --> 00:01:58.916
Who are you showing that to?

00:02:18.041 --> 00:02:18.708
Grandpa,

00:02:19.541 --> 00:02:21.458
do you not like the piece I played?

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:23.458
I can play many more.

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:25.791
Grandpa really likes this piece.

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:27.291
You played with

00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:28.750
the spirit of "High Mountains Flowing Water,"

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:30.666
as if searching for a soulmate.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.291
It sounded beautiful.

00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:34.625
Grandpa,

00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:36.958
do you ever feel lonely too?

00:02:38.583 --> 00:02:39.708
Grandpa

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.083
doesn't lack friends.

00:02:42.041 --> 00:02:43.833
But you shared with Grandpa

00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:45.458
the stories of those who fight against fate.

00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:46.583
They overcome destiny

00:02:46.958 --> 00:02:48.708
and immerse themselves in happiness.

00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:50.458
Grandpa is very happy.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.083
Keep practicing.

00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:54.000
Okay.

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:06.000
Captain

00:04:06.416 --> 00:04:08.166
Would anyone cross the river in this cold?

00:04:08.416 --> 00:04:09.000
Yeah.

00:04:09.208 --> 00:04:11.250
Only a madman would cross the river on a night like this.

00:04:11.875 --> 00:04:12.916
Damn it!

00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:14.208
Stop talking.

00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:16.125
Keep your eyes wide open tonight.

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:18.375
Captain

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.791
There's a boat over there.

00:04:27.125 --> 00:04:27.583
You guys,

00:04:28.125 --> 00:04:28.708
go check it out.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.750
Yes, sir.

00:05:42.583 --> 00:05:43.875
Captain, watch out! It's dangerousâ€”go!

00:06:02.083 --> 00:06:02.583
How is it?

00:06:02.791 --> 00:06:03.208
It's time.

00:06:03.208 --> 00:06:03.916
Get the boat out now!
