00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.880
Lanterns here!

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.520
Lanterns here!

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.600
Lanterns for sale!

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.920
I heard you want to go find your Madam?

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.440
I'll take you there.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.440
Madam told me not to go with strangers.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.240
But I'm not a stranger.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.400
I'm your foster father.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.840
What's a foster father?

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.720
Well... It means a father

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.040
who didn't birth you

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.320
and doesn't share your surname.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.480
I already have a father.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.600
Did your father buy you this?

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.200
You bought the fish lantern.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.080
Now will you come
find your Madam with me?

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.160
Why are you more eager than me
to find my Madam?

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.880
If you want to go, why not go alone?

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.200
I don't want to.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.960
Kid, don't talk nonsense.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.520
I'm just trying to help you.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.200
You're not being honest.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.320
I won't go with you.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.560
Then I won't give you this lantern.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.160
Slow down. Don't get lost.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.080
Keep up. Don't fall behind.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.600
Jin.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.600
Madam. Madam.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.160
Why did you come out alone?

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.760
She insisted on seeing you.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.120
I couldn't refuse.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.800
So I brought her here.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.360
That's not true.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.000
I bought you the lantern, right?

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.920
Who would've thought
the cold-faced Lord Shen

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.800
has such a childish side?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.200
There's been no gang activity
at the docks recently.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.440
I wonder what they're plotting now.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.440
The street kneeling protest
didn't go as they planned.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.120
Their next move will be significant.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.760
Be cautious with it.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.240
Ningzhou has been
under their tight control for years.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.400
I actually hope they'll take action.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.520
That way, they might
reveal their weaknesses.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.440
Let's go home.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.520
Madam,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.560
I want to take a look over there.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.280
No, it's too late.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.720
Let's go.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.120
Maybe we should go there.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.640
I'd like to see
Ningzhou's local customs too.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.680
This way, you can spend time with Jin.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.440
Jin, want to go?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.240
Yes.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.720
Let's go.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.080
No wandering off.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.520
Okay.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.560
I found the person
I asked you to locate.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.880
Where?

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.840
The day that Lu family's concubine
was poisoned,

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.640
someone sneaked
into the Lu residence at midnight.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.320
The Lu family guards spotted him.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.760
During pursuit, they found this boot.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.200
This belongs to Tao Dushan's crew.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.480
The witness is hiding among our people.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.400
I'll go find him.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.920
Come back.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.880
Don't be reckless.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.560
You want to strike once and gain thrice.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I'm on it right away.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.000
This is Ningzhou's most famous snack,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.600
called Lard Rice Dumpling.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:58.480
Try it, my lord.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.080
It sounds greasy.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.400
Not at all.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.880
Just try it.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.680
Pinwheels and clay figures! Take a look!

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.960
Pinwheels and clay figures! Take a look!

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.280
Father, I want a pinwheel.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.400
Pinwheels and clay figures!

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.120
Give me a pinwheel.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.000
I want that one.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.800
Pinwheels and clay figures!

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.080
Jin.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.160
Father, I want this.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.960
Want it?

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.216
Yes.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.440
Which one do you like?

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.600
Call me father.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.440
- I want this one.
- I'll buy it for you.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:30.560
Want one?

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.560
Okay.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.960
Which style do you want?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.920
If you don't call me that,
you can just look.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.960
Just look then.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.560
Just this one.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.000
These are for boys.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.280
How could girls play?

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.120
Merchant!

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:47.280
Hello, there.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.600
Which one do you want?

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.440
I'll take them all.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.120
Great, great! Thank you.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.400
- Thank you.
- Deliver these to Duting Station.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.600
Absolutely, no problem.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.160
Don't buy so much. It's wasteful.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.360
Jin,

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.960
if you want something in the future,
just say it.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.600
If you like it, you like it.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.160
Never let yourself endure hardships.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.560
There's no difference
between boys and girls. Understand?

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.160
Yes.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:14.960
Do you understand?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.760
Yes.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.840
Hurry. Say thank you
to your foster father.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.520
Thank you,

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.240
Father.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.160
What did you say? I didn't catch that.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.760
Beautiful flower boats!

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.840
Would you like to ride a flower boat?

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.200
This is the last trip.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.200
You'll regret it
if you don't take a look.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.400
- We won't ride.
- We will.

Yes.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.000

Well... Let me take her.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.880
It's fine. I'll escort you inside.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.960
If people see us,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.640
it wouldn't be proper. Come on.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.120
Come on

00:07:25.248 --> 00:07:28.096
(Lu Residence)

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.280
Thank you for tonight.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.800
My daughter has never

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.760
been this happy before.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:38.680
Think nothing of it.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.920
This is all part
of being her foster father.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.000
I'll leave.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.000
(Thanks to you both.
I'm very happy too.)

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.640
Madam.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.600
You little rascal. Pretending to sleep?

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.280
I was very happy today.

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.480
It felt like a dream.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.400
I don't want to sleep.

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.040
I fear the dream will end.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:25.880
From now on,

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.800
I won't let you live in fear anymore.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.720
Is it because father is protecting us?

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.640
Jin, you must remember this.

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.400
Never pin your hopes on anyone else.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.240
Except me, of course.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.200
You've changed so much
since father came.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.000
Why when he's not around,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:51.520
you agree to call him father?

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.440
Actually, I'm willing to call him father
in my heart.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.680
But the more he wants me to say it,

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.600
the less I'll call him that.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.600
I'm just teasing him on purpose.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.640
You little imp!

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.720
You're the only person in the world
who dares tease him.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.160
Let's go.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.760
My lord, this is the place.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:30.800
My lord.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.560
There's no sign of anyone living here.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:35.960
Perhaps we get the wrong place?

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.720
The mark on that letter

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.400
indicates this person
has met Princess Anhe

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.960
and the pirates.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.680
He also knows about the slave mark
on Ye Qinglan's back.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.920
The only possibility is
that he was once from Duting Station

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.200
and has long lingered
around the Lu family.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.320
But in our investigation,

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.840
only Firewood Workshop's
Chai Er was suspicious.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.640
He used a fake identity

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.000
providing firewood
to the Lus for three years.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:06.480
But when I started to investigate,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.440
he vanished.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:10.360
Looks like this.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.800
We haven't come openly for the old case.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.960
So he won't trust us.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:24.600
Yes.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.000
He's hiding.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.520
Gao Fu.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.080
My lord.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.840
Get me some water.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.480
Understood.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.680
Here's the water.

00:11:04.704 --> 00:11:07.520
(The Sang family is innocent)

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.200
The Sang family is innocent.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.904
(Duting Station)

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.080
Lord Shen.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.280
Master Lu.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.880
Where have you been?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.800
You've been hard to find.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.440
What brings you here?

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.280
Here's the thing.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.240
You have repeatedly saved
my concubine from danger

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.840
and recognized my daughter
as your foster child.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.680
I haven't thanked you properly yet.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.360
So I've prepared a feast.
Please honor us with your presence.

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.640
It's nothing.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.520
No need for such formalities.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.000
My lord, I come with sincere intentions.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.640
I hope you won't decline my offer.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.720
Very well. Since you are so generous,

00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.880
I shall not stand on ceremony.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.760
Please, my lord.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:10.840
My lord.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.560
I know you must feel lonely
traveling away from the capital.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.640
I've arranged some young ladies
to keep you entertained.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.840
Rest assured.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.520
They've been instructed

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.280
to maintain discretion
and protect your reputation.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.840
Your consideration is commendable.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.120
You're an honored guest.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.480
Ordinary wine

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.440
won't suffice.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.560
Coming.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.400
Ladies, come here.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.200
Hurry up.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.440
Come here.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.400
Serve these gentlemen well.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.520
Put it down.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.440
Cease your anger.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.160
My apologies, Master Lu.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.880
These aren't to my taste.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.640
Go. Let's go.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.880
So you prefer...

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.760
What do you think?

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.880
Not a problem. I understand.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.280
Okay. I'll bring her immediately.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.240
Here she is.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.360
She's new here. Untouched.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:16.360
Untouched?

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.480
That means she's never
entertained clients.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.360
Surely she suits your preferences?

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:24.720
Come here.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.320
Go on. Move!

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.920
How old are you?

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:30.880
Sixteen.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.680
Sixteen?

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.840
Why would you come to Duchun House
at such a young age?

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.760
Your family got troubles?

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.480
My lord,

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.600
if this fledgling doesn't please you,

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.800
I'll find another. Let's go.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.960
Please, my lord. Save me.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.040
My father lost in gambling.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.232
So he sold me to this place.

00:14:51.232 --> 00:14:52.520
- I don't want to stay here!
- Let's go.

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.480
Please, my lord!

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:54.880
Let's go!

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.040
- My lord!
- Wait!

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.200
My lord,

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.880
this transaction is already paid for.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.640
We'd better not interfere.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.680
Indeed, my lord.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.680
Right.

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.480
Master Lu is hosting
this banquet, after all.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.640
I shouldn't burden
your generosity further.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.200
What are you talking about?
If it pleases you,

00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.880
I'll spare no expense tonight.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.600
Go get her indenture.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:22.960
Okay.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.000
