=Lust and Lies=

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.000
Beishan.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.119
Beishan,

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:41.799
Qingwan is back.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.320
Madam, what's wrong with you?

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.159
Why would a performer be Qingwan?

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.159
You gave this jade pendant to Qingwan
as a one-month-old present.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:58.359
Remember?

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:03.840
On her back,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.000
there's a scar from falling off a horse
as a kid.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.079
Does such a coincidence exist?

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.359
Of course not.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.840
She's our daughter.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:33.560
Mr. Zhao,

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.959
what if Boss Huo finds out
we acted on our own?

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.239
If he blames us,

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:38.040
I'll take responsibility.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.040
Feifei mustn't be harmed today.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.140
=Episode 3=

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.039
What are you afraid of?

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.000
You're pointing a gun at me.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.000
Of course, I'm scared.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.039
I don't believe my daughter
would appear out of nowhere.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.039
Tell me.

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:42.919
What are you plotting?

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.560
To be honest,
I find it hard to believe too.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.240
I've spent 15 years
searching for my parents,

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:54.919
and suddenly they appear.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.840
I know my place.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.520
I'm a mere performer.

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:01.800
How would I dare dream
of being a daughter of the Huo family?

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:04.240
Today,

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.400
allow me to perform one last song
for First Madam.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.439
From this day on,

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.199
I'll never set foot
in the Huo Residence.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.439
Beishan.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.840
Fine.

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:21.639
I'll pull the trigger now.

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.759
If you die,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:23.919
I'll accept you as my daughter.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.280
But if someone rescues you,

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.080
I'll kill you all.

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:31.400
What's the difference?

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:34.120
I have to die anyway.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.879
Of course there is.

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.080
One will be buried with honors

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.759
as a daughter of the Huo family,

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.439
the other will die with no tomb

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.680
as a bandit.

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.240
Beishan,

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.520
I've been praying every day

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.560
that Qingwan will return.

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.120
I'm begging you.

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.919
Please.

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:56.360
Aunt,

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.800
today's your birthday.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.039
You can't kneel.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.199
Aunt.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.520
Aunt.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.199
Get up.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:03.199
First Madam,

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.400
you don't have to do this for me.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:07.080
In this life,

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:09.599
our time together may be short.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.280
In the next,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.439
I hope I can call you mother again.

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.800
Father, I'm so scared.

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:36.000
If you're afraid,

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:37.240
pinch your arm.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.480
You won't be scared

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:39.480
when you feel pain.

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:18.519
Qingwan.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.279
Don't be afraid.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.519
Mother is here.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.600
Mother is here.

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:22.519
There, there.

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:23.920
Mother is here.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.279
Today,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.879
I'll spare you.

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:34.000
Thank you, Governor.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:36.519
Get up.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.560
Aunt.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.920
What do you think?

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.319
I find Miss Yan Qing very interesting.

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.759
Let her into the Huo Residence for now.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.160
If she's plotting something,

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:05.360
keeping her close

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.759
is safer.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.519
Good.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.079
Keep a close eye on her.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.079
Also,

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:18.360
investigate those people outside.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.959
Here.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:20.560
Please.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.199
Come on.

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:23.319
Understood.

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:26.600
Come on.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.639
Get on with your work.

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:27.920
Come on.

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:28.519
Mr. Zhao,

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.079
is Miss Ruan really safe there?

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.120
(Zhao Xun, Second-in-command of Huofeng Gang)
She gave me a signal to leave.

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:37.199
I trust her.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.820
(Huo Residence)

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.399
Digging around like this

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.079
will get attention.

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:08.000
Xiu,

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:09.600
I was just

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.439
looking for my jade pendant.

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:13.920
It's with me.

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:20.279
Thank you, Xiu.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.759
Who actually are you?

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.279
One moment you're Yan Qing,

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:29.160
next you're Huo Qingwan.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:31.759
Xiu,

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:34.199
I'm Yan Qing.

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:36.160
But then

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.879
I became

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.480
the daughter of the Huo family.

00:07:46.879 --> 00:07:47.600
I should get going.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.480
Xiu,

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:04.360
undressing a woman you meet

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:06.240
is rude.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.879
Besides,

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:19.680
we're now siblings.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.639
That's improper,

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:23.160
Xiu.

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:25.920
Sorry,

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:27.160
Qingwan.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.240
I need to take a good look

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.080
at the scar on your back

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:34.879
and see if it's new

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.159
or old.

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.320
Young Marshal Huo who kills
without blinking

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.080
is shutting his eyes tightly.

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:00.279
Ah, right.

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:02.639
I should thank you.

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:05.840
If you hadn't helped unzip my clothes

00:09:06.519 --> 00:09:08.720
and revealed the scar to Mother,

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:11.240
we wouldn't have recognized each other.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.120
Thank you.

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:33.320
Did she

00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:35.200
break into my room yesterday?

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.480
She claimed she wanted her jade pendant back.

00:09:40.919 --> 00:09:42.440
I checked her back.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.039
It's an old wound.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:50.679
Governor,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.480
Miss Yiyi prepared
a bowl of soup for you.

00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:06.480
But I think

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.120
the scar is new.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.840
You've worked hard performing outside.

00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:25.480
I had the kitchen

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.639
prepare seafood soup.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
It's nourishing.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.080
Yiyi,

00:10:35.799 --> 00:10:37.039
did you also send some for Governor?

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:37.519
Yes.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.080
Uncle, Aunt,

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.679
and Cousin Xiu all received some.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.240
So they all know

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:44.480
you made it?

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.399
What are you getting at, Qingwan?

00:10:48.879 --> 00:10:49.480
Nothing.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.159
I just feel bad for you,
living in someone else's house

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:54.080
and always having to be wary
of their moods.

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:55.480
It must be hard.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.320
Qingwan was allergic to fish and shrimp
when she was a kid.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.399
Test it on her tomorrow.

00:11:03.799 --> 00:11:04.600
What if

00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:07.120
she's not Qingwan?

00:11:07.399 --> 00:11:08.799
For those with ill intentions,

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.679
I never spare them.

00:11:27.639 --> 00:11:28.559
Drink up, Qingwan.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
The soup is cooling.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.200
Qingwan.

00:12:16.639 --> 00:12:17.120
Qingwan!

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:17.960
Are you all right?

00:12:20.159 --> 00:12:20.759
Uncle.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.640
â™ªListen, the bell rings from afarâ™ª

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:09.720
â™ªThe fog lifts, your image still hazyâ™ª

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:16.360
â™ªDo you remember the sound of the flute
in the wind?â™ª

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:23.320
â™ªIt whispers of the flame we sharedâ™ª

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:34.480
â™ªHaving seen those prophecies
left behindâ™ª

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.320
â™ªA sudden will to survive arisesâ™ª

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:41.920
â™ªThe ruan resounds with grandeurâ™ª

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.320
â™ªUnder the pelting plum rainâ™ª

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.600
â™ªEveryone sings the final actâ™ª

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.800
â™ªAll fading awayâ™ª

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.320
â™ªThe curtain fallsâ™ª
