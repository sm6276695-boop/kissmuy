=Episode 13=

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.680
I'm sorry.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.480
I came too late.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.160
It's not your fault.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.600
It's them.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.960
You've also risked your life

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.600
to get here.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.120
Uncle, here's some candy for you.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.680
Thank you, Lady Jin.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.600
Jin.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.240
Mother, look.
This uncle made me a toy ox.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.160
So pretty. Did you thank him?

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.200
You spend money on her every time.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.840
No need to bring gifts next time.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.760
Just a simple craft from the mountains.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.560
As long as Lady Jin likes it.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.320
I'm sorry about your brother.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.120
When we return,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.080
I'll have Gao Fu retrieve his remains.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.240
I'll give him a proper burial.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.800
Thank you.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.160
(Mu, wait here for me.)

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.680
Can you accompany me
to the Baiyi Alley textile shop?

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.080
Okay.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.752
(Baiyi Alley textile shop)

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.640
The letter.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.560
What are you doing?

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.720
The letter's inside.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.560
The letter's inside!

00:03:18.624 --> 00:03:20.896
(Duting Station)

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.360
Mu.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.840
Mu.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.440
Mu.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.760
Why are you so reckless?

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.480
You didn't ask anything,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.360
and didn't know my plan,

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.720
yet you charged in anyway.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.280
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.920
Lord Shen is alive and well.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.520
Don't jinx him, Lady Ye.

00:05:27.616 --> 00:05:28.576
He's breathing, right?

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.600
My lord,

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.320
was anything left
in Baiyi Alley textile shop

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.840
yesterday?

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.800
When I arrived,

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.640
the shop had collapsed.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.800
Most items inside were burnt to ash.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.560
Nothing remained?

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.000
I searched the ruins thoroughly,

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.480
but found nothing.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.280
Were nearby households affected?

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.680
Several houses next to it
were completely burned.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.080
Over ten people injured,

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.800
three fatalities.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.600
Lady Ye, you...

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.840
I'm fine.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.040
Are you alright?

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.440
Stop worrying about other matters.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.280
Focus on recovering first.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.680
Last night, I dispatched people
to handle the aftermath.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.680
In the eyes of nobility,

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.240
someone like me

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.320
doesn't even deserve

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.120
a coffin when dead.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.280
Whether you deserve it or not
has nothing to do with others.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.040
But since they treat human life
as nothing,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.680
we must seek justice
for the wrongfully killed.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.400
Don't worry,

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.920
I'm tough to kill.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.560
As for your brother's death,

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.120
I came too late. I'm sorry.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.720
It was not your fault.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.920
I...

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.520
Let's exchange secrets.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.320
I'll reveal my identity,

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.720
and you tell me yours.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.480
Lady Ye,

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.640
what do you mean?

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.120
That letter was indeed
sent by my brother,

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.920
but it was a secret missive
for Duke Xuan's heir.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.840
Yet now, it's in your hand.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.800
Either you serve the Young Lord,

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.240
or

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.120
you're the enemy who intercepted it.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.120
Lady Ye.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.400
Listen.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.920
The Inner Bureau
is under the Royal Bureau.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.920
By ancestral law,
it answers to the Emperor alone,

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.320
immune to external oversight.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.040
I serve the royal family.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.800
That letter is in my hands.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.920
Naturally, there's a reason for it.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.600
But I can tell you

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.040
I

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.520
am not the Young Lord's enemy.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.280
I trust you.

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:38.520
You...

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.400
I'm the daughter of Postmaster Sang Kui
from Duting Station.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.200
My lord, please redress
my family's injustice.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.600
Get up.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.360
I knew what you just said

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.560
long ago.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.320
You knew?

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.280
Then...

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.160
Then why did you...

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.920
Princess Anhe's death
has always been suspicious.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.880
But your father truly
was in charge of Duting Station.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.040
So he can't escape accountability.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.840
Unless we find the real killer.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.280
My lord,

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.880
Master Lu is here
asking about Lady Ye again.

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.600
Are you that eager to see him?

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.480
Because I want to know
who killed my parents

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.560
and my brother.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:45.920
That's exactly why

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.360
we can't let them know

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.560
we've returned.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.720
Listen to me. Rest here for a few days.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.240
I'll keep investigating,

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.480
seek justice for you,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.280
and bring Jin back.

00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.400
You'll both be free
from the Lu family for good.

00:10:06.656 --> 00:10:08.384
(Prefect's Mansion)

00:10:08.384 --> 00:10:09.200
(Verses, wine, and arms breed new burdens.
Plum as wife, crane as son, all past karma.)

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.200
Verses, wine, and arms
breed new burdens.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.640
Plum as wife, crane as son,
all past karma.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.240
My lord.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.520
What is it?

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.600
Those pirates botched the job.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.320
Shen Que has come back again.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.520
Let him be.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.240
Officials and citizens in Ningzhou
has always stood united.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.720
He's just a lowly Governor-General.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.160
Can he really overturn
our entire system?

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.520
My lord,

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.880
I remember you never applied medicine
for minor wounds like this.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:45.960
But now, you...

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.320
Stop all that nonsense.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:47.960
Wait...

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.480
- Apply the medicine.
- Out.

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.400
- Apply the medicine.
- Get out! Hurry.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.208
Apply the medicine.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.840
It heals without the medicine?
Am I a miracle physician?

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.400
Lord Gao.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.920
Well, I see.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.960
Lady Ye, you're here.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.440
Lord Shen is inside.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.440
Thank you.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.120
My lord,

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.400
you want me here
for the Young Lord's matter, right?

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.880
I'll turn my back on you.
As for the Young Lord,

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.400
I think we should...

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.520
Why does my wound hurt so much?

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.640
Could it be infected or something?

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.280
Never mind.
Let me help you apply the medicine.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:27.720
Okay.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.280
Your help is appreciated.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.160
You needn't trouble yourself like this.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.880
It's okay. It will be easier this way.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.000
I won't look if that's better.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.360
No. Even if you won't look,
I need to look...

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:41.120
Who's been applying medicine for you
all these years?

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.480
Well... I grew accustomed
to the battlefield.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.160
Such minor wounds
aren't worth fussing over.

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.080
It feels m-much better.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:12:59.920
How strange.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.360
I have something for you.

00:13:17.773 --> 00:13:18.320
(The Lu family poisoning case
in Ningzhou 18 years ago)

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:19.240
This letter...

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:24.880
Normally, I should let you keep this
as a memento.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:27.160
But under current circumstances,

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.960
it's best burned.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.200
Mu kept such a heavy secret

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:36.120
for me for so many years.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.080
Turns out

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.960
they let me live

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.440
only to hook him.

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.880
How much do you remember from back then?

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:11.760
I was young.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.320
I only remember

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.440
a beautiful lady came to the station.

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.120
She treated us so kindly.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.480
Come on.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.480
Eat well,

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.720
so you can grow up strong.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.680
It's so delicious.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.640
Make a guess.
Is it a boy or girl in my belly?

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.640
I think it's a girl.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:43.840
What do you think, Sangye?

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.240
I want to hear it.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.080
Come on.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.600
He's kicking me.

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.040
It must be a boy.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.800
Will you name him then?

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.600
My father taught me a poem.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.800
Silver saddle illuminates white steed,
galloping swift as meteors speed.
