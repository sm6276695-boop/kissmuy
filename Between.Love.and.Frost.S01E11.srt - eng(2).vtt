[Episode 11]

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.040
Flowers for you.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.120
Happy birthday in advance!

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.200
Thank you.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.920
I haven't really had time

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.240
to buy a proper gift yet.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.280
Here.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.600
This is

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.600
my mother's necklace.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.480
She left it to the one I treasure most.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.660

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.020

вҷӘI hesitate in every word
and every momentвҷӘ

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.620
Looks beautiful on you.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.540
Thanks. I also have a gift for you.

вҷӘCome to me, my loveвҷӘ

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.360
I want to spend

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.220
all birthdays

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.220
вҷӘThere will always be a gapвҷӘ

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.280
Thank you.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.180
I'll never forget this moment

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.200
and today.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.280
It's raining.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:12.600
I'll go get the rickshaw.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:13.840
Wait here for me.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.400
Why don't...

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.400
we just stay out tonight?

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.440
I'd like to freshen up first.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.760
Alright.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.160
Well? Hesitating?

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.200
For revenge,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.160
there's nothing I wouldn't do.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.040
I'll wash up too.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.760
Minghui, I'm soaked through.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:45.920
Wait for me for a second.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.000
Can't wait any longer.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.760
Feel like drinking some wine. And you?

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.000
Good.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.040
Sorry.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.600
Really, I'm so sorry.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.080
What are you saying?

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.360
Minghui.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.480
Come out.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:33.840
Chu Minghui,

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.880
you really are cold-hearted.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.680
Well done.

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.960
What do you mean?

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.120
Order your troops to retreat

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.480
from the Military Governor's Mansion.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.760
In your dreams!

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.160
Don't push me to kill you.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.040
Hello.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.640
Zhao Jun,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.160
leave with your team.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:38.760
Yes.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:44.360
You seriously think

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.960
Gu Tongpei will forgive you for this?

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.260
Don't move!

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.780
What are you doing?

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.100
I'm asking what you are doing.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.180
Why?

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:55.860
Why?

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.340
вҷӘLove is an abyss one cannot escapeвҷӘ

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:05.700

вҷӘI feign, struggleвҷӘ

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.680
You deceived me.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.220
Flee, and breakвҷӘ

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:40.140
вҷӘThe endless shackle of darknessвҷӘ

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:41.020
Go.

[Ward 21]

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.900
Mr. Gu, you're finally awake!

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:31.780
Take it slow.

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.340
How long was I out?

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.020
Five days.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.140
Where's Chu Minghui?

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.180
No one can locate her.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.180
The physician advised you to rest.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.300
No strenuous activity.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.140
Get lost!

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:04.820
That's impossible.

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:06.860
Mr. Gu,

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.220
that bullet pierced through your thigh

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:10.820
and hit your private parts.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.620
We've done everything within our power,

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:13.820
but we couldn't save it.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:14.860
You may

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.100
lose your fertility.

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.220
Say that again!

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.340
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.060
We did try our best.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.700
If this gets out,

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.300
I'll tear you to pieces.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.820
Where did Chu Minghui hide Father?

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:13.780
Don't mention her!

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.780
If you hadn't conspired together,

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.180
she never could've taken him away!

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.620
You did it, but won't admit it.

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:23.180
Are you even a man?

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.660
She deceived me and betrayed me

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.620
time after time.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.340
Right now, I wish I could find her

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:51.980
and kill all of you!

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.460
I'll find my father

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.660
and then tell him what you've done!

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.620
None of you will escape this!
