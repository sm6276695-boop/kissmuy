00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.439
Get rid of that warehouse at once.

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:43.840
I don't want

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:46.240
to get threatened again.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.200
Yes, sir.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.679
However,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.600
this storeroom matters a lot
to Young Marshal Huo.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:54.719
I'm afraid

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.920
it's not easy to deal with it.

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:58.399
Yes, sir.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.040
I dare you to move them!

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.159
No one

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.000
gets to mess with this storeroom,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.159
including Governor!

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.359
Get lost!

They all say my mother killed herself.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.400
But I saw

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.159
him killing her.

Mother!

Mother!

Mother!

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.039
Let go of me!

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:13.680
Mother!

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:16.759
Mother!

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:20.560
Ever since my mother went mad,

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.360
she'd been locked up in here.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.199
She was locked up here for five years.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.919
So Mother was paying respect
to your mother

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.599
in the mountain.

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.280
But I only dared pay respect
to her in secret.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.439
Sometimes I'd stay her for some time

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.280
until the incense went off.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.800
I don't want to lose you.

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:22.639
From now on,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.079
you're all I have.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.480
Don't you ever leave me.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.439
And don't betray me.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.040
Are we having a deal here?

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.120
I entrust my life to you.

I hope

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:08.040
this fire will burn
the entire residence.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.800
Wenyan...

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.759
Wenyan!

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.319
It's on fire!

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:26.000
The storeroom is on fire!

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:27.920
Help!

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:30.480
Governor.

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.560
Tell them to forget about it.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.439
I was going to get rid of it

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.240
after all.

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:39.959
Miss Qingwan did it.

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:52.600
How reckless of you!

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.079
I acted rather recklessly

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.990
to make the Governor believe
that I don't harbor any ill thoughts.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.560
I'm just trying to ease his burden.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.240
Moreover, that storeroom

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:05.120
always bothered him.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.959
It was his weakness too.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.600
Someone had to get rid of it for him.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.839
Mother.

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.519
You fought with Governor
for times because of me.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.800
Only when I gain a foothold

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.600
can I protect you.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.839
In this family,

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:27.199
you need to learn

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.199
how to protect yourself first.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.319
Got it, Mother.

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:38.759
Miss.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.959
Governor asked for your presence
in the army headquarters.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.600
Please.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.360
Careful, Miss.

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:01.240
Governor,

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:02.240
Miss Qingwan is here.

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:10.079
Aren't you scared?

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.199
I believe

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:14.519
you won't kill me.

00:07:15.319 --> 00:07:15.879
Why?

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:19.399
It's because all fathers love their children.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.480
Don't kill me!

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.000
Governor.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.560
Miss Qingwan is nowhere to be seen.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.680
Do we keep setting fire on it?

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:40.519
(Qingwan.)

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.240
(Don't blame me.)

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.279
(Find yourself a good family
in the next lifetime.)

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.199
After everything I've done
in the past few days,

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:05.000
don't you resent me?

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.199
It's all thanks to you

00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:08.480
that I'm now free
of the Huofeng Gang's control.

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:10.319
Father, I just want you...

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.959
Governor, I just want you to be safe and sound.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.240
If you want to call me Father,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.959
just do it.

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:36.400
You've been wandering around
since you were young.

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.120
I haven't taught you anything.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.639
Today,

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.360
I shall teach you how to use a gun.

00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:51.440
Father...

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.159
Bear this in mind.

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:06.240
Don't ever let someone
point a gun to you.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.159
Unless you're good enough to put up a fight.

00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:11.440
Here.

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:13.440
Afraid not.

00:09:14.559 --> 00:09:14.919
One.

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:16.159
Two.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.120
Three.

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:18.120
Shoot.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:21.679
Father!

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.840
I've got it, Father!

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.600
Governor.

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:33.159
Qingwan.

00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:34.799
Head back and get some rest.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.879
Thank you, Governor.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.960
Today's the happiest day in my life.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.000
Call me Father.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.279
Thank you, Father.

00:10:00.759 --> 00:10:01.759
She knows how to shoot a gun.

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:07.519
She'd have hid the fact
that she knows how to use a gun

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.240
or pretended she can't hold one steady

00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:13.159
or even fired a near miss.

00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:15.480
She would never hit the bullseye.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.360
She's my daughter.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.559
