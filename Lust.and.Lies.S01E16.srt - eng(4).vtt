=Lust and Lies=

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:56.359
Father?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.840
You went to the army headquarters
to steal Governor's keys?

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:15.719
You'd better put it back.

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:16.400
Why?

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:18.680
Getting ready to be his lapdog again?

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.359
Since Zhao Yun's death,

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:22.640
you've been irrational.

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:27.159
If you take the Lion Seal away,
naturally, Governor will suspect you.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.159
So be it.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.719
With the Lion Seal,

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:32.200
I need not pretend to be Huo Qingwan,
who disgusts me.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.159
What did you say?

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.060
=Episode 16=

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:12.240
Governor.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.159
I found your keys.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.400
Where is Qingwan?

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.490
She said she was tired
from the gun training.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.240
She's taking some rest.

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:48.759
Have you found me a locksmith?

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:49.759
After all,

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:51.560
everyone is coveting the Lion Seal.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.840
To make sure nothing goes wrong,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.199
we need to find someone reliable.

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.800
Go on.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.919
Are you alright?

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.080
I'm fine.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.220
Huo Beishan has figured out
the Huofeng Gang's whereabouts

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.599
and caught many of its members secretly.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.879
The leader asked you
to figure out a way to save them.

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:27.479
Got it.

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:29.039
Tell them to relocate

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.319
those robbed arms at once.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.280
Huo Jin.

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.879
Brat.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.120
What are you doing here?

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.240
Nothing.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.159
I got some random stuff here.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.080
You may have it.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.000
It's for me?

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.960
I think it quite suits you.

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.599
Thanks.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.599
Go home now.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.159
Miss.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.360
What are you doing here at this late hour?

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.639
You look quite lovely.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.680
Come on.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.800
I'll take you home.

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.720
Let's go.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.000
Let go of me!

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.079
You wench!

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.800
How dare you hit me!

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.160
Get over here!

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:32.160
Wench!

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:33.759
Today, I shall teach you a lesson!

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:34.639
Let go of me!

00:04:44.079 --> 00:04:45.439
No matter how wretched I am,

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:48.199
I'm a heiress after all.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.000
A rogue like you had better
keep your hands off me.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.920
(Huo Qingwan.)

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:25.079
Qingwan.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.839
So this is where you used to live.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:29.240
That's right.

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:32.759
You must have had a lot.

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:41.800
I haven't played this game.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.360
I'll join them.

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:48.839
If you want to play it,

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:49.800
I'll join you.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.800
Why?

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:53.560
The formidable Young Marshal Huo

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.199
wants to be the hen?

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:57.240
As long as you're happy.

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:00.920
Fine.

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:02.759
I'll be the eagle, then.

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:04.199
Sure.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.279
Let's play it.

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:06.680
I am

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.199
a big hen.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.519
I've got you!

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.839
This is no fun!

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.639
I quit.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.079
Don't run!

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.279
Catch him already!

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:44.560
Both of you are unbelievable.

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:09.199
Beishan.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.279
I've come up with this guest list.

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:12.120
Take a look

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.399
and see if it needs any amendment.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.839
I'll leave that to you.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.920
We must make sure

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.000
the banquet goes well

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:21.240
so that Qingwan

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:22.439
will gain her recognition

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.920
as the heiress of our family.

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:24.279
Governor.

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:26.399
We found this letter at the door.

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:39.519
Beishan!

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.160
We've been kidnapped!

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.360
Governor.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.480
Everything's ready.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.360
Go ahead.

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.079
Mr. Huo, may you have an absolute victory.

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:04.680
Oh, right.

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:06.439
There's one more thing.

00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:09.120
I know

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:11.439
the leader of the Huofeng Gang.

00:08:18.879 --> 00:08:19.480
Miss Ruan.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.639
Will Huo Beishan release them?

00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:29.360
His most beloved son is with us.

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:32.360
So it's worth trying.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.440
This time,

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:41.360
I want Huo Beishan dead.

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:45.960
The Huo Army is here.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.279
Where are they?

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:22.720
Wake them up first.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:47.879
Qingwan.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:48.840
Qingwan.

00:09:49.519 --> 00:09:50.240
Are you alright?

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.559
Qingwan, don't be afraid.

00:09:53.039 --> 00:09:54.120
I've been kidnapped

00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:55.200
for times.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.720
Father will save us.

00:09:57.559 --> 00:09:58.240
Let's do an exchange.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:14.799
Tell Huo Beishan to come here.

00:10:15.159 --> 00:10:16.440
These are his children.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.240
As their father,

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:20.039
is he going to be a coward now?

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.399
Governor said,

00:10:21.799 --> 00:10:24.240
if you dare hurt
anyone of the Huo family,

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:26.399
we'll get rid of these people.

00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:32.919
Aren't they

00:10:33.159 --> 00:10:35.039
like your family with whom
you've spent your time?

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:54.159
Deal.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.120
Qingwan!

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.320
It's the Huo Army!

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:36.919
How dare they trick us!

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:38.240
We'll fight them til the end!

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:38.960
Charge!

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:39.759
Huo Jin!

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.039
Huo Jin, are you alright?

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:45.960
Stop it!

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:46.799
Don't shoot!

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.080
Huo Jin!

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:49.879
Take Young Master Huo Jin home first!

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.279
Huo Jin!

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:02.919
