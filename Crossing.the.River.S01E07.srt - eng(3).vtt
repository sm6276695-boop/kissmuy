00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:23.083
Report.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.541
Did you catch him?

00:01:34.208 --> 00:01:34.916
Not yet.

00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:36.875
We cleared the scene.

00:01:38.083 --> 00:01:39.125
There were five people in the car.

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:41.000
Four escaped.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.541
One was injured.

00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:47.250
What about Zhao Jiaqi?

00:01:54.083 --> 00:01:54.958
I'm asking you.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.333
Where is he?

00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:57.708
Injured.

00:01:58.583 --> 00:01:59.125
Missing.

00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.500
An injured man

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:06.083
actually

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.833
managed to slip away from you.

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:10.083
We've set up a net at the hospital.

00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:11.500
He can't get away.

00:02:15.666 --> 00:02:17.208
The engineers are a minor issue.

00:02:19.083 --> 00:02:20.291
Catching Zhao Jiaqi

00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:21.791
is the top priority.

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:27.166
I wanted to use him as bait.

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:28.666
To catch a big fish.

00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:32.125
A big fish.

00:02:32.833 --> 00:02:34.750
I think he's the big fish.

00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:38.083
In my opinion,

00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:40.708
he's at best a big shrimp.

00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:43.333
So full of himself.

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:46.666
In our line of work,

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:49.416
the worst mistake is assuming.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.291
You have three days.

00:02:53.208 --> 00:02:54.041
Dead or alive,

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:55.708
you must find Feilong.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:58.166
Yes.

00:03:36.125 --> 00:03:36.666
Boss Zhao

00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:42.125
The situation in Nanjing is getting worse.

00:03:43.958 --> 00:03:45.250
Everyone says the Communist forces are about to cross the river.

00:03:46.583 --> 00:03:47.583
What are your plans?

00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:51.416
No matter who wins or loses,

00:03:52.083 --> 00:03:53.791
whether it's the Communists in power

00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:54.916
or the Nationalists in charge,

00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:57.041
business is business.

00:03:57.583 --> 00:03:58.250
It still needs to go on.

00:03:59.416 --> 00:03:59.958
I think

00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:02.125
we should keep the factory running.

00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:05.041
Boss Zhao,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.791
Instead of

00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:09.083
waiting in such a dangerous situation,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.791
it's better to sell the factory early.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.041
Find a more comfortable place

00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:17.166
and live a peaceful life.

00:04:19.083 --> 00:04:19.833
Comfort?

00:04:21.416 --> 00:04:22.291
Where can you find comfort now?

00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:25.125
Only a new future

00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:26.541
can bring comfort and peace.

00:04:35.083 --> 00:04:36.166
Is there still a future?

00:05:18.125 --> 00:05:18.708
Lao Hu

00:05:19.125 --> 00:05:20.125
Heading south this time,

00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:21.125
where are you planning to go?

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.416
Where to?

00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:24.458
I don't want to go anywhere.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.083
I'm staying right here.

00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:27.708
What can anyone do to me?

00:05:29.708 --> 00:05:30.750
At a time like this,

00:05:31.041 --> 00:05:31.958
why bother pretending?

00:05:32.833 --> 00:05:33.875
I have a brother in Taiwan, China.

00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:34.916
His business is huge.

00:05:35.208 --> 00:05:35.833
Want to go?

00:05:37.916 --> 00:05:38.583
Or to the US?

00:05:39.541 --> 00:05:40.291
Taiwan, China is too small.

00:05:40.916 --> 00:05:42.083
For people like us,

00:05:42.666 --> 00:05:43.666
what could we even do there?

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:45.375
If I were you,

00:05:46.208 --> 00:05:47.000
I'd go to Taiwan, China.

00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:51.541
Why?

00:05:52.458 --> 00:05:54.500
All those antiques and paintings you swindled and plundered—

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.458
do you think Americans would appreciate them?

00:05:56.833 --> 00:05:57.916
Could you even trade them for dollars?

00:05:58.583 --> 00:05:59.416
Mingyu,

00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:01.083
what are you getting at?

00:06:02.791 --> 00:06:04.541
I've always treated you like a brother.

00:06:04.958 --> 00:06:06.083
There's something behind your words.

00:06:07.458 --> 00:06:09.500
You have the nerve to talk about brotherhood.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.875
Is a brother someone you cheat?

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.708
Mingyu.

00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:15.666
What do you mean by that?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.375
Huh?

00:06:17.083 --> 00:06:18.166
How have I wronged you?

00:06:18.416 --> 00:06:19.000
Tell me.

00:06:21.083 --> 00:06:21.833
These past two years,

00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:23.416
how many cigarettes have you smuggled?

00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:24.708
How much explosives have you sold?

00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:25.875
Have you counted it all up?

00:06:26.666 --> 00:06:28.166
If the Inspection Office comes asking,

00:06:29.166 --> 00:06:30.500
will you still keep your head?

00:06:30.875 --> 00:06:31.500
Have you thought about that?

00:06:33.791 --> 00:06:34.500
Mingyu,

00:06:35.333 --> 00:06:36.208
be straightforward.

00:06:36.541 --> 00:06:37.166
Just say it.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.875
What do you want?

00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:41.916
We're brothers.

00:06:42.458 --> 00:06:43.125
You know that.

00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:44.208
Without me,

00:06:44.416 --> 00:06:45.166
things wouldn't have gone so smoothly for you.

00:06:45.916 --> 00:06:46.375
How about this—

00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:47.375
let's make a deal.

00:06:47.916 --> 00:06:49.125
I just want some peace of mind.

00:06:50.416 --> 00:06:50.583
Come on,

00:06:52.291 --> 00:06:53.041
let's settle this.

00:06:58.416 --> 00:06:59.000
Name your price.

00:07:00.458 --> 00:07:01.833
If money can solve it,

00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:03.041
it's not a real problem.

00:07:03.916 --> 00:07:04.750
This money,

00:07:05.375 --> 00:07:06.208
whether it's in your pocket

00:07:07.333 --> 00:07:08.291
or kept with me,

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.333
it's all the same.

00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:10.916
It's all the same.

00:07:11.375 --> 00:07:12.958
I don't want money, and I'm not going to Taiwan, China.

00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:15.208
I can't even spend this money.

00:07:15.833 --> 00:07:17.541
You keep it and live it up in America.

00:07:20.083 --> 00:07:20.583
Then—

00:07:21.375 --> 00:07:22.125
what do you want?

00:07:23.458 --> 00:07:25.208
I want to trade your family's lives

00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:26.541
for a look at a document.

00:07:27.833 --> 00:07:28.541
What document?

00:07:29.291 --> 00:07:30.750
The Jiangsu power grid map.

00:07:32.083 --> 00:07:33.541
That's a top-secret document.

00:07:34.166 --> 00:07:35.666
You could lose your head for that.

00:07:37.458 --> 00:07:38.958
But today, I want to see it.

00:07:39.416 --> 00:07:40.541
Is the document more important,

00:07:40.833 --> 00:07:42.125
or is your head more important?

00:07:52.833 --> 00:07:54.750
You're with them now, aren't you?

00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:57.083
What do you mean, "with them" or "with us"?

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:58.375
I am Chinese.

00:08:50.833 --> 00:08:51.458
Take care of yourself.

00:08:54.916 --> 00:08:55.250
Don't worry.

00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.166
We'll all wait for that day.
