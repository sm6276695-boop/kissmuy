=Lust and Lies=

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:41.520
Miss.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.399
First Madam told me to pass this to you.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.880
What is this?

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.679
First Madam said
you lost a pair of earrings.

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:52.679
To cheer you up,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.320
she got this especially for you.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.100
=Episode 13=

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:34.359
She has the cheek to be staying here

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.319
after committing such a shameful act.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.480
Did you stay out all night

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.879
to practice violin again?

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.040
We're having this again.

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:54.439
Instead of having your breakfast,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.200
where are you going?

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:57.120
You're such a busybody.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.159
You look all unkempt.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.159
If Governor came home
and saw you in this state,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.680
he'd scold you again.

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:15.280
Alright.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.980
Go on and keep your violin away.

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:40.240
Pardon me, Governor!

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.360
The merchant ship was robbed

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.580
and the Sheng family offered
to pay five times the compensation.

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:50.960
The credit is all yours.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.960
Thank you, Governor.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:54.080
Let's dig in.

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:00.120
What are you doing?

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.400
Did you tie that?

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.719
Yes.

00:03:04.966 --> 00:03:06.286
Qingwan liked to dress you up this way

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.759
when you were young.

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.639
Governor.

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:30.360
What is it?

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.719
Father!

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.400
Father!

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.800
Scram!

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.719
Tell me.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.759
Where did you get this?

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:06.319
Miss.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.439
Today,

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.280
you've upset Governor.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.479
Because of that pair of earrings?

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:16.560
Listen here.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:17.800
This pair of earrings

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:20.959
actually belonged to another madam.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.120
Back then,

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:23.560
Governor married her.

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:25.160
She went crazy

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:26.000
not long after that.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.399
She always tried
to get rid of Governor.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.480
To our surprise, she eventually took her own life.

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:32.560
She even cursed Governor

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.800
an ugly death.

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:34.839
Finally, she tore off

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:36.399
part of Governor's arm.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.680
Miss.

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:39.959
You must be cautious after this.

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:41.360
I'm off.

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:55.920
Those earrings belonged to your mother?

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.560
Yes.

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:59.319
Someone has tried to frame you

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:00.120
with my mother's tragedy.

00:05:04.839 --> 00:05:05.439
Don't worry.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.360
I'll help you.

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:19.399
Governor.

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.800
I've passed your message
to Miss Qingwan.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.920
It's time to create chaos
in this household.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.439
Only then do I get to know

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.199
whose side they're on.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.839
Now,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.839
let's see how we can turn the tables
with this white piece.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.519
Do we join hands

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.959
or hurt each other?

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.540
(Huo Residence)

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:05.439
Governor.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.279
Are you here to plead on her behalf?

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:08.759
No.

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.330
I've found out
that she's part of the Huofeng Gang.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.800
Huofeng Gang

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.560
are refugees stationed at sea.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.160
And they robbed

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.279
the merchant ship full of arms.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.660
(Huofeng Gang)

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:26.959
Where are those arms now?

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:28.439
I've sent our men to look for them.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.920
Then

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.759
I'll sneak those arms back here.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.040
Not only will we lose nothing,

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.400
but we'll also receive the five-time
compensation from the Sheng family.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.079
As expected of my good son.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.879
However, explain yourself.

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:47.240
Why are you doing this?

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:55.920
I know you've always
found her suspicious.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.920
Thus, to figure out her identity,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.720
I approached her on purpose.

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:02.079
You've raised me up.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.480
Of course I'm always on your side.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.000
Fine.

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:12.920
Bring that Huofeng Gang woman here

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and prove

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:17.600
whose side you're actually on.

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:22.160
Why?

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:24.560
You can't bring yourself to do so?

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.199
I won't let you down.

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:30.120
Great.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.040
Xiu told me

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:39.600
that you're from the Huofeng Gang.

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:43.120
I know nothing about that.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.600
This is salt water.

00:08:02.959 --> 00:08:04.639
Once the whip has tore your flesh apart,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.600
the salt water will enter your wound.

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:13.240
Since you refuse to come clean,

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:14.439
don't blame for what I'm about to do.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.759
Let's see how long you can stay stubborn.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:36.919
This dagger.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:38.799
Do you recognize it?

00:09:04.159 --> 00:09:06.320
Well, take good care of her.

00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:10.440
Take him away.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:28.919
So?

00:09:29.759 --> 00:09:30.759
Have you made up your mind?

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.720
This man said he knows you.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:43.320
Yes.

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:46.879
I'm part of the Huofeng Gang.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.360
They turned me into a showgirl

00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:52.240
to get them money

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.080
and be their mole.

00:09:54.879 --> 00:09:56.039
If I didn't do as they said,

00:09:56.039 --> 00:09:57.120
they'd hit me.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.399
During the birthday banquet,
I sneaked into the Huo Residence

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.879
to get them intel.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.799
To my surprise,

00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:06.519
I'm the daughter of the Huo family.

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:09.279
If so,

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.240
this man is the one
who barged in to the residence.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:23.960
That's right.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.759
I thought

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:31.200
no one could bully me

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.799
when I found my parents.

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:34.519
Unexpectedly,

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.399
they caught me

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:37.399
and told me to assassinate you.

00:10:37.799 --> 00:10:38.919
But how could I do so?

00:10:38.919 --> 00:10:40.279
You're my father after all!

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.360
Tell me.

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:50.840
Who's the leader of the Huofeng Gang?

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.039
Who's the leader

00:10:59.639 --> 00:11:00.799
of the Huofeng Gang?

00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:04.320
I don't know either.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.559
Its leader rarely made an appearance.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.639
She's nothing but an ungrateful orphan!

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.440
She didn't have the right
to meet the leader!
