00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:12.041
Director

00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:17.708
How's the progress?

00:01:18.958 --> 00:01:19.583
According to plan.

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.083
We can take action tomorrow.

00:01:21.916 --> 00:01:22.541
This time,

00:01:23.041 --> 00:01:23.708
he won't get away.

00:01:28.083 --> 00:01:29.750
These people

00:01:30.416 --> 00:01:31.333
are so cunning.

00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:35.208
Will they believe your intel?

00:01:37.083 --> 00:01:37.750
They should.

00:01:38.916 --> 00:01:40.333
If we come up empty-handed,

00:01:41.083 --> 00:01:42.666
we'll alert the enemy.

00:01:44.958 --> 00:01:45.833
I've taught you this.

00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:48.125
Without absolute certainty,

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:50.875
never act rashly.

00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:53.458
Please trust me, Sir.

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:55.333
We'll definitely act tomorrow.

00:01:57.875 --> 00:01:58.458
Good.

00:01:59.291 --> 00:02:00.541
You truly are my student.

00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:41.250
Tomorrow, two groups of power experts will be transferred.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.833
They are involved in all transmission networks in Jiangsu.

00:02:44.458 --> 00:02:45.708
Once they're sent to Taiwan, China,

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:46.833
Jiangsu

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:49.125
could fall into darkness at any moment.

00:02:49.666 --> 00:02:50.458
Are you ready?

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:52.666
There are four per train.

00:02:52.916 --> 00:02:53.958
Three per military vehicle.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.083
We're planning to take action in Zhenjiang.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.041
We can't touch the ones on the train.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It could be a trap.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.250
Let the comrades in Shanghai handle it.

00:03:04.125 --> 00:03:05.083
I'll take care of the ones in the military vehicles.

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:07.791
Okay.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.875
Inspection.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.000
Can't you read?

00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:57.791
Sorry, Sir.

00:03:58.041 --> 00:03:58.666
He's new here.

00:03:59.083 --> 00:03:59.541
Go.

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:02.208
Don't move.

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:10.291
Surround them.

00:04:12.291 --> 00:04:12.625
Get off.

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:16.625
Hurry up.

00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:17.708
Get down.

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:19.916
Hurry up.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.791
Move!

00:04:27.458 --> 00:04:27.708
Hurry!

00:04:29.666 --> 00:04:29.916
Quickly!

00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:34.500
Stand straight.

00:04:36.458 --> 00:04:36.708
Brother,

00:04:37.583 --> 00:04:38.458
We're on official duty.

00:04:39.083 --> 00:04:39.583
Let's talk this out.

00:04:41.291 --> 00:04:42.166
Which unit are you from?

00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:43.583
Which unit?

00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:46.333
Ever heard of Boss Sun?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.416
What bullshit mission are you on?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.250
What the hell does that have to do with me?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
In times like these,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.500
Chiang Kai-shek won't let me survive.

00:04:59.208 --> 00:05:00.208
I have to find my own way.

00:05:04.708 --> 00:05:05.250
You three,

00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:07.291
Who do you work for?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.333
Them?

00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:10.291
They're my friends.

00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:11.666
Talk to me if you have something to say.

00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:12.333
It's got nothing to do with them.

00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:13.000
Get out of the way.

00:05:13.583 --> 00:05:14.000
I wasn't asking you.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.291
Speak.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.250
What are your names?

00:05:20.458 --> 00:05:20.875
What do you do?

00:05:22.916 --> 00:05:23.250
Hero,

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:26.041
My name is

00:05:26.583 --> 00:05:27.083
Fang Zhengyi.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.916
I'm an engineer at Central Radio Company.

00:05:30.958 --> 00:05:31.291
He,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.791
He's Zhang Yibin.

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:34.750
From Jiangnan Power Plant.

00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:35.416
Chief Engineer.

00:05:36.083 --> 00:05:36.333
Oh, right.

00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:37.791
And him,

00:05:39.291 --> 00:05:41.791
He's the Chief Engineer at Southern Cement Plant.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.125
His name is Zhang Fayin.

00:05:45.166 --> 00:05:45.875
Sir,

00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:47.916
We've never done

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.125
anything immoral.

00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:50.625
Please,

00:05:51.833 --> 00:05:52.541
let us go.

00:05:56.208 --> 00:05:57.291
Let you go?

00:05:59.166 --> 00:06:01.416
You three look well-educated.

00:06:01.916 --> 00:06:02.958
You must be worth something.

00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:06.000
I'll trade you for some cash for my men.

00:06:06.208 --> 00:06:07.250
Please don't kill us.

00:06:08.041 --> 00:06:09.083
We have elderly parents and young children to support.

00:06:09.208 --> 00:06:09.625
If you kill us,

00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:10.666
what will happen to them?

00:06:11.375 --> 00:06:11.750
That's right.

00:06:12.333 --> 00:06:12.708
Exactly.

00:06:12.708 --> 00:06:13.166
Don't worry.

00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:15.333
I'm not going to kill you.

00:06:16.291 --> 00:06:17.625
I want money.

00:06:19.583 --> 00:06:20.166
But,

00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:24.083
if you try anything funny,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.125
then it's not just about money anymore.

00:06:28.708 --> 00:06:29.125
Boys,

00:06:30.583 --> 00:06:31.333
Strip their clothes.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.333
Tie them up.

00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:32.958
Take them away.

00:06:34.458 --> 00:06:34.958
Boss,

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.000
Let's go.

00:06:36.541 --> 00:06:36.791
Move.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.291
Chief,

00:06:44.583 --> 00:06:45.125
Boss,

00:06:45.916 --> 00:06:46.666
Please let us go.

00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:47.625
Boss,

00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:48.791
Don't go.

00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:51.708
Chief,

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:57.958
Hurry!

00:06:59.708 --> 00:07:00.083
Keep up.

00:07:07.791 --> 00:07:08.041
Hurry up.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.458
Come on.

00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:11.708
Get in the car, quick.

00:07:13.458 --> 00:07:13.666
Hurry!

00:07:14.041 --> 00:07:14.291
Look here.

00:07:18.541 --> 00:07:18.875
You all,

00:07:19.083 --> 00:07:19.375
Fall back!

00:07:33.708 --> 00:07:34.166
Don't be nervous.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.583
Zhao Jiaqi from the PLA Nanjing advance team.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:39.250
I'm responsible for your safety.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.541
Where are we going?

00:07:42.666 --> 00:07:43.000
Don't worry.

00:07:43.625 --> 00:07:44.291
We won't leave Jiangsu.

00:07:45.166 --> 00:07:46.541
I'll take you to a safe place first.

00:07:47.125 --> 00:07:48.000
Just wait a couple of days.

00:07:48.666 --> 00:07:49.166
Everything will be fine.

00:07:56.458 --> 00:07:57.041
Keep driving.

00:07:57.875 --> 00:07:58.833
Head to a safe spot up ahead.

00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:00.000
Get everyone to run quickly.

00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:08.333
I'll cover this side.

00:08:08.666 --> 00:08:09.291
Chief.

00:08:09.541 --> 00:08:10.208
This is too dangerous.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:11.500
Follow orders!

00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:38.250
Experts, come with me.

00:08:38.625 --> 00:08:38.833
Move!

00:08:39.708 --> 00:08:39.916
Hurry!

00:08:40.083 --> 00:08:40.291
Quick!

00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:41.083
Go!

00:08:59.166 --> 00:08:59.875
Everyone's in the car.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:00.333
Go after them!

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:08.000
Chase them!
