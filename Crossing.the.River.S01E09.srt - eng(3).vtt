00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.500
Tell me.

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:15.416
Who made you do this?

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:16.875
If you talk,

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:18.083
I'll send you back.

00:01:33.958 --> 00:01:34.791
Still not talking?

00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:45.000
So you still won't say?

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:52.208
Time to get rough.

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:11.333
Speak.

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:13.791
The sooner you talk, the sooner you're free.

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:16.666
I just want

00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:32.916
to stop living like this every day, half alive.

00:02:33.041 --> 00:02:34.291
I'm worn to a shadow.

00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:38.791
Exactly.

00:02:39.208 --> 00:02:40.125
Who doesn't feel the same?

00:02:40.416 --> 00:02:41.041
It's so annoying.

00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:42.791
Why haven't they made their move yet?

00:02:44.208 --> 00:02:44.708
If only they'd blow it up sooner.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.875
Then we could get out.

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:47.041
Everyone thinks that.

00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:54.333
Why hasn't the delivery guy arrived today?

00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:02.833
Come in.

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:09.208
Sirs.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.083
Please, have another drink.

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:14.541
It's my treat.

00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:18.208
What made you invite us for drinks?

00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:20.291
No need to say that, gentlemen.

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:23.208
First, you always look after my business.

00:03:24.625 --> 00:03:25.666
Second,

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.666
there's a small matter.

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:29.333
I want

00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:30.791
to trouble you, sirs.

00:03:32.958 --> 00:03:33.583
for some help.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.666
What the hell can we help with?

00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:38.708
We're stuck here like prisoners all day.

00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:39.958
We can't do anything.

00:03:40.583 --> 00:03:41.208
We can handle it.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.875
We can handle it.

00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:45.666
It's just a small favor for you.

00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:46.708
Oh?

00:03:47.708 --> 00:03:48.708
Then tell us.

00:03:52.333 --> 00:03:53.541
In our factory,

00:03:54.041 --> 00:03:55.791
aren't there some scrap copper wires?

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.083
I want to take them out.

00:03:59.833 --> 00:04:00.791
Exchange them for some cash.

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:03.416
That way,

00:04:03.625 --> 00:04:06.583
we'll have money for drinks in the future.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.375
No need to say more.

00:04:13.666 --> 00:04:14.416
Let's drink.

00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:17.500
Grab a stool.

00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:18.208
Come on, sirs.

00:04:26.583 --> 00:04:28.291
I just want to trade some cables.

00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:30.375
Make a little money for drinks.

00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:37.875
And then?

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.208
I don't believe you.

00:04:40.375 --> 00:04:42.250
You're not doing this just for a little cash.

00:04:44.708 --> 00:04:45.625
Let me tell you.

00:04:47.375 --> 00:04:48.750
Your mom is in my hands.

00:04:50.125 --> 00:04:50.875
Want to

00:04:51.083 --> 00:04:52.333
hear her voice?

00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:01.375
You jerks!

00:05:01.875 --> 00:05:03.541
You'll die horribly!

00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:06.000
Mom!

00:05:07.791 --> 00:05:08.625
Speak.

00:05:09.083 --> 00:05:10.125
What's really going on?

00:05:11.416 --> 00:05:12.625
Otherwise,

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.958
today will be the day you and your mom die.

00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:17.666
I'll talk.

00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:20.958
Actually,

00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:26.833
it's all for that

00:05:29.375 --> 00:05:30.666
power plant blueprint.

00:06:09.791 --> 00:06:10.541
Come on, cheers!

00:06:14.375 --> 00:06:15.291
Hey, Sirs.

00:06:15.791 --> 00:06:16.208
Let me

00:06:16.458 --> 00:06:17.500
toast you all again.

00:06:30.125 --> 00:06:30.666
Bro,

00:06:33.541 --> 00:06:34.583
Are you looking down on your little bro?

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.666
No, not at all.

00:06:36.791 --> 00:06:37.333
Come on.

00:06:37.458 --> 00:06:38.000
No way.

00:06:39.083 --> 00:06:40.291
Who only drinks half a glass?

00:06:40.625 --> 00:06:41.083
Come on.

00:06:42.833 --> 00:06:44.041
You take half, I’ll take a full one.

00:06:46.291 --> 00:06:47.500
Bottoms up!

00:06:48.208 --> 00:06:48.625
Drink, drink, drink!

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.083
Drink!

00:06:54.583 --> 00:06:55.916
I want another round.

00:07:00.958 --> 00:07:02.458
There’s just a little left.

00:07:03.208 --> 00:07:04.375
Once it’s gone, we split it three ways.

00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:07.791
Alright, forget about him.

00:07:35.916 --> 00:07:36.666
Big Bro.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.666
Big Bro.

00:07:41.791 --> 00:07:42.416
Big Bro.

00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:03.458
Hurry up!

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.125
Come on, faster!
