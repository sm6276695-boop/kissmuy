00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.020
[Episode 15]

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.870
If you truly feel for her,

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.070
stop putting her through.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.760
You almost pushed her to her death,

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.400
and now you feel sorry. Huh?

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.070
A grown man,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.640
even if faced with great difficulty,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.310
shouldn't take it out on a woman.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.120
What should I do with you?

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.070
The one I love most

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.560
killed my closest family.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.480
All I wanted was the truth.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.710
But I dread what it might be.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.070
I fear I may have to kill you,

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.710
but I can't bring myself to do it.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.280
Whether I live or die,

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.310
I'll only cause him pain.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.750
I might as well stay far away from him.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.470
That way,

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.120
he'll perhaps gradually forget all this.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.560
Apologies for your suffering,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.360
Mr. Chu.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.680
But as long as you agree
to my condition,

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.800
I can let you go anytime.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.400
In the past,

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.310
under my father's protection,

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.150
you made quite a profit

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.080
from the military supplies business.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.470
You can still continue on this,

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.360
but

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.710
the profits will be up to me.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.000
I...

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.030
can agree to that,

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.190
but we must sign a contract.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.120
With the late Mr. Gu,

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.120
it was fifty-fifty.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.040
It should

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.160
stay that way.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.000
Mr. Chu,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.720
your brain's not injured.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.720
Why are you spouting nonsense?

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.190
You'd better think it over.

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.800
After all,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.120
the dead don't need money.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.920
I'll agree.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.120
Whatever you say.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.950
Let's see.

[Contract]

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.120
Once you press your fingerprint,

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.750
all the money will be yours.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.720
Mr. Gu,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.120
from now on, I'll serve under you.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.680
Here's to you.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.040
Mr. Gu, don't kill me!

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.920
Please don't kill me!

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.190
Mr. Chu,

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.270
as a businessman,

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.040
why would you bring a gun

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.390
to sign a contract?

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.190
Right?

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.870
If you like playing tricks,

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:21.800
then I'll play rough.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:25.070
Mr. Gu,

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.510
I'm sorry.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.120
No, I mean,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.920
Military Governor Gu,

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.160
please spare me this time.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.870
All my money is yours.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.870
You have the say.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.560
Please spare me

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.120
this time.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.360
Remember,

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.920
there's only one end

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.310
for those who betray me.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.750
I knew I wasn't wrong about you.

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.310
I'll notify them right away.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.510
Tomorrow is the first 7-day memorial
for the old governor.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.920
We'll fully support you in succeeding
as the new Military Governor.

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.360
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.800
Miss Chu, run away.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.800
While Mr. Gu is away
at Master's memorial,

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.120
I'll help you get out.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:53.430
Okay.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.510
Miss, it's time for...

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.750
Don't bother packing clothes.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.320
Just take money and some dry rations.

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:38.750
Leave quickly.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.790
Thank you, Qiao.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.550
Don't thank me.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.750
Getting rid of you big trouble
makes life easier for me.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:49.550
Qiao!

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.440
Open the door!

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.320
Get out!

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.120
Qiao.

00:08:58.750 --> 00:08:59.550
Qiao.

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:03.750
Get me some money.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.720
I cut ties with you long ago.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.600
You only come to us

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.790
when gambling leaves you broke.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.270
Even beasts have
more conscience than you.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.480
Let's go. Ignore him.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.790
Get out.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.750
You wretched woman,

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.120
mind your own business.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:19.670
I'm warning you,

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.200
bother them again,

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.320
and I'll cripple you.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.910
You dare hit me?

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.320
This is my turf!

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.120
Today I'll deal with both of you!

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.120
Miss Chu, are you okay?

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.960
What did you just call my woman?

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.390
I said...

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.270
I said, Madam,

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.750
Miss, Kind Miss,

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.320
beautiful and kind-hearted...

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.150
Get lost!

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.480
You haven't even healed yet.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:54.360
Why are you going?

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.120
You haven't explained anything to me.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.550
Did I allow you to leave?

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.120
Let me go,

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.670
and let yourself go too, will you?

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.390
Don't even think about it.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:03.910
This life of yours,

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:05.870
I went to great lengths to save it.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.790
You'd better take good care of it

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.320
and cause no more trouble.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.320
Mr. Gu!

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.320
It was all my idea.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.120
Just punish me.

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.120
You let her go
while she's still injured.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.000
I should punish you.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.960
Let her go.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.200
It has nothing to do with her.

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.360
You pushed me to this!

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.960
Miss Chu!

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.120
Are you okay?

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:31.550
Get out.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.550
There won't be a next time. Out!

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.270
Yes, sir.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.630
How did things

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.550
end up like this between us?

[Memorial Tablet for Gu Rongchong]

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.270
At least you showed up.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.390
Tongpei was only late
because of urgent matters.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.720
Tongpei,

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.510
the auspicious hour has passed.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.510
We've done the rites.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.320
Go light incense for Father.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.320
You're late
even to your father's memorial.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.960
You neglect military affairs too.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.200
What are you doing all day long?

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.550
Our father's sudden death

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:49.120
left Tongpei

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.550
grief-stricken too.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.320
He didn't mean to neglect

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.480
military affairs.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.790
Everyone, please be understanding.

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:00.550
We've discussed it.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.870
Pei is too impulsive

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.510
to succeed as Military Governor.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:05.960
Ce,

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.670
only you are fit for the role.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.670
You've conspired long ago.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.360
Why put on this act before me?

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.960
I never cared for the position.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.140
Becoming the governor
is only the beginning.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.420
I'll make you all pay in time.

00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.460
Qiao, hang in there!

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:26.860
Push!

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:30.700
Are you okay?

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:31.940
Qiao's water broke.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.500
We need to deliver the baby immediately.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.180
Die, fetch another basin of hot water.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:36.020
Okay.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:38.220
Breathe.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.740
You haven't fully healed. Don't push it.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.900
It's urgent, and I'm fine right now.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.700
Why are you standing there? Get out!

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:44.580
I'll go help.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.820
Keep it up. The baby's almost out.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.420
Breathe in.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.020
This child is meant
to have a connection with you.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.020
If you don't mind,

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.620
let her acknowledge you
as her sworn parents.

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.420
Okay.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:30.580
Mr. Gu.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.780
Mr. Gu,

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:40.740
I'm the doctor
who examined the late Mr. Gu.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.500
My name is Song Lin.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.780
Mr. Gu Tongce forced me

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.300
to falsify the autopsy report

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.020
of the governor.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:49.220
The true cause of death
was a gunshot wound to the chest.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.180
I never planned to reveal this secret.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.180
But as soon as he
became Military Governor,
