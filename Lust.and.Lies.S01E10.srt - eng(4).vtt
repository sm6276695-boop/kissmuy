=Lust and Lies=

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.159
Qingwan, what's wrong?

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.359
Nothing.

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.760
I lost a pair of my earrings.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.270
I've been trying
to figure out where I dropped them.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.480
It's just a pair of earrings.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.840
I can get you

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.159
any earring you want.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.200
By the way, Mother,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.200
why did you suddenly want
to go to the mountain to pray?

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.120
I go every year to pay respects to the lost souls.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.400
Lost souls?

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.560
Madam,

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:37.439
everything is ready.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.000
I've made up my mind.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.239
Whether your feelings

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:00.519
are real or fake,

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:03.879
it doesn't matter.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.159
Then what does?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.879
What matters is

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.199
that you're here

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:15.479
by my side.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.100
=Episode 10=

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.400
Hey.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.199
What's going on here?

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.840
What are you doing here?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.240
I asked him

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.319
to take me out.

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:54.120
Let's go.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.120
Stop the car.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:17.800
Even though I know

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:19.319
you're using me to get at him,

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.000
I'm still happy.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.400
If you keep
getting tangled up with Huo Xiu,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.919
I'm afraid you'll forget why you came
to the Huo family in the first place.

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:32.479
I don't need you to remind me.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.159
I know what I need to do.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.159
My hair…

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:37.479
Well, you have plenty anyway.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.080
You spent the whole day out
with Sheng Weilian.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.800
Did you even want to come back?

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:57.759
What's that got to do with you?

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.759
Huo Xiu, what are you trying to do?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.479
If someone sees us,

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.560
I'll just say you seduced me.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.639
Huo Xiu,
aren't you done causing a scene?

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.720
Not yet.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.439
Do you even realize

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:27.920
you're coming off like a desperate stray,

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:30.160
howling for attention?

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.279
I don't have time to play your games.

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:41.759
If you have nowhere
to vent your frustrations,

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:44.439
go find some other woman.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.800
Other women?

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:58.439
In this family,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.879
you're my brother.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.959
I'm your sister.

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:02.600
You better remember that.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.680
Don't tell me

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.079
you love Sheng Weilian?

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.319
I do.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.460
(Huo Residence)

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:36.120
(Ruan Feifei,)

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.759
(love gets in the way of plans.)

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.399
(You still have a blood debt to settle.)

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.079
Miss,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.839
Governor is asking
to see you in his room.

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:51.279
Governor.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.839
What do you want now?

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.600
I was called here too.

00:06:24.519 --> 00:06:26.120
That's low, even for you.

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:28.560
Someone wants to drug us.

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:29.920
Wasn't it you?

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:32.319
This is Governor's room.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.000
Would I try to drug both of us here?

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:52.879
You really do drink anything, huh?

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:57.519
I'd rather be a confused victim

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.720
than be sober
and misunderstood by Governor.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.720
Don't overthink it.

00:07:05.399 --> 00:07:06.680
We'll find whoever's behind this.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.560
I bet whoever set this trap

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.000
will have an interesting reaction

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.839
when they see us losing it

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:17.920
in the Governor's room.

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:38.519
Uncle,

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:40.800
I made you some chicken soup.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.519
Have some
before you go back to your room.

00:07:42.639 --> 00:07:43.879
You really should have some…

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:47.040
Is something wrong?

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:53.439
Xiu and Qingwan…

00:07:58.839 --> 00:07:59.319
Uncle.

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:00.319
Uncle!

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.320
Ready?

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.240

she's the one who drugged the liquor?

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.120
Yes,

00:10:46.279 --> 00:10:47.000
I'm sure.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:57.879
Uncle,

00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.759
I did

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.519
drug the liquor.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:03.879
But I meant it

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:06.240
for myself.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.279
Someone mistook the liquor.

00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:09.879
The truth is,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.679
I already have someone special in mind.
