00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:42.719
Qingwan.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.799
Have a safe journey home.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.439
What a shame.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.679
Since your return,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.479
I haven't managed to treat you well.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:03.799
Do you still remember it?

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.439
When we were small,

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.120
we made a pledge

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.680
to visit so many places.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.840
And I haven't taken you to any of them.

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.319
Don't cry.

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:27.840
Tears

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:31.840
will make you look bad.

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:39.640
Huo Jin?

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.239
Huo Jin?

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.840
Huo Jin...

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.920
Huo Jin!

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.920
Huo Jin!

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.959
Is this the ending that you want?

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:05.680
You kidnapped me here

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.319
to give yourself a way out, right?

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:10.919
Because you knew

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.199
I'd protect you.

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:15.919
And you knew I'd let the Huofeng Gang go

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:18.680
because of you.

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.520
You've manipulated me

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.120
using my love towards you.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.439
You're free to use me too.

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:43.800
I don't care.

What kind of girl likes such a stuff?

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.399
We're one step closer to our vengeance.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.079
Aren't you glad?

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.810
But I've caused
those innocent people's deaths.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:50.879
Zhao Xun

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.959
and the Ruan family.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.040
All of them were innocent too.

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:57.399
Living in this world,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.500
we can't judge what is right
and what is wrong.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.959
The only way

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:02.600
is an eye for an eye

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.720
and a tooth

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.720
for a tooth.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.399
We shouldn't
have treated Liu Yiyi this way.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.720
At least she's sincere with you.

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:16.120
Well,

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.759
all she cares about

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.240
is my family property, no?

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:20.879
There's nothing sincere about her.

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:24.079
Could it be

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:27.680
that you and Huo Xiu
are sincere with one another?

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:31.600
Huo Jin is dead.

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:33.519
Huo Beishan
has been postponing his burial

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:34.680
and insisted on having the banquet.

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:37.439
I can't help but find that fishy.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.900
What's there to be afraid of?

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:42.319
That's our engagement party.

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:46.120
We're the stars of the day.

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.439
Have you been waiting here for long?

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.879
You and Sheng Weilian

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.920
met there?

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:44.399
You seem to be all-knowing.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:45.600
I know

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:48.000
more than you thought.

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:52.839
But I've chosen to be ignorant because of you.

00:07:58.439 --> 00:08:00.120
But you've never believed me.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.040
That's because you're full of secrets,

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.360
and I can't figure you out.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.600
Don't stop me

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:08.920
from doing what I want.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.439
Are you sure

00:08:27.959 --> 00:08:29.519
Qingwan held the gun?

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.079
Uncle.

00:08:32.759 --> 00:08:33.600
I swear.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:36.399
She's had it all planned out.

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:47.000
I will kill you!

00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:22.480
All the guests are almost here.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.000
Hang in there.

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:08.480
Congratulations!

00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:09.879
Congratulations!

00:10:09.919 --> 00:10:10.840
Congratulations!

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.360
I have an announcement to make.

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:14.919
My daughter, Huo Qingwan,

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:16.590
and the Sheng family
will have a marriage alliance.

00:10:16.639 --> 00:10:18.300
An auspicious date will be picked
for the wedding.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.559

- Great!

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.240
