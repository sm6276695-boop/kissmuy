=Spring Fever=
=Episode 4=

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.160
If you touch me again,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.280
I'll kill you.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.920
What happened yesterday
was just an accident.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.080
Don't misunderstand.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.320
I've seen plenty of women.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.680
But I rarely encounter

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.680
living criminal slaves.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.880
If you tell me

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.960
what crime you committed

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.400
and how you escaped execution,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.664
I'll spare you.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.456
A'man.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.352
What are you doing?

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.696
Let go of me.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.136
Getting desperate?

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.240
Then speak the truth.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.720
Or else,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.480
I won't mind playing the adulterer.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.040
Three.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.240
Two.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.240
A'man, are you there?

00:01:37.088 --> 00:01:38.120
One.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.800
I was adopted by the Lu family
as a child.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.600
Later, I fell gravely ill

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.160
and lost all my memories.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.320
You liar.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.192
I'm coming in.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.048
Qinglan,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:15.648
what are you...

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.048
Shi'an.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.840
What brings you here?

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.600
My concubine is injured.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.200
I came to show my concern.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.160
- Concern?
- Exactly.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.440
Did you bring any food?

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.208
No.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.480
Any medicine?

00:02:36.384 --> 00:02:37.360
No.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.760
Then what did you bring?

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.200
I brought premium

00:02:41.312 --> 00:02:42.320
pearl powder.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.280
Where is it?

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.520
You just smashed it.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.480
So you brought nothing.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.400
You claim to show your concern,

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.840
yet bring no food

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.792
nor medicine.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.360
Are you here to spy

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.880
on my interrogation records?

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.880
In-Interrogation?

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.200
You came for an interrogation?

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.240
What else?

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.120
Want to hear more?

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.120
No.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.800
Please go ahead, my lord.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.936
Shi'an.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.240
(Prosperity Blessed by Heaven)
(He's too dangerous. Don't provoke him.)

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.920
Wait. This is my house.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.840
He sneaked in at night,

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.400
and secluded himself with my concubine.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.440
Close the door.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.336
Alright.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.200
Shi'an, is there something
you need to say?

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.960
A'man, please understand my predicament.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.072
(Prosperity Blessed by Heaven)

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.200
I don't know if his predicament is real,

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.520
but my interrogation

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.040
is real.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.480
Let go of me.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.360
Or I'll scream.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.624
Scream?

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.480
Who would care?

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.320
Who else in the Lu family
would care about you?

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.880
It seems you need motivation

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.360
to start talking.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.040
What are you doing?

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.280
What did you apply on me?

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.480
Poison for interrogating criminals.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.160
On open wounds, it burns like blades.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.200
Will you talk?

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.320
Stubborn fool.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.600
I truly remember nothing.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.600
Nothing at all.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.360
It's okay.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.720
Madam. Madam.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.216
Jin,

00:05:13.536 --> 00:05:14.840
why are you here?

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.560
(Lu Jin'er, Ye Qinglan's daughter)
I heard you were hurt.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.560
I'm fine.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.840
I just had a fall.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:27.120
Let's go. Let me take you out.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.416
Okay.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.640
Didn't I ask you to stay
in your father's room for a while?

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.240
It felt wrong.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.472
Come here.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.040
This is all my fault.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.640
You're the best.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.280
Look! The woodcutter uncle
gave me a horse.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.280
He keeps bringing you trinkets?

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.560
He taught me a rhyme too.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.840
Ox hooves, horse feet...

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.096
It's South Mountain high,
North Dipper in the sky.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.320
The master buys a cow to tie.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.360
Right.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.960
Come on.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.600
Iron feet go, stamping the ground.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.560
Over South Mountain, stepping around.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.760
South Mountain high,
North Dipper in the sky.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.440
The master buys a cow to tie.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.200
(There's something here
I can't let go of.)

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.800
(You can't let go of your man,
or the wealth and glory?)

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.720
(So what she truly
can't let go of is her daughter.)

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.960
Iron feet go, stamping the ground.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.240
Over South Mountain, stepping around.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.880
South Mountain high,
North Dipper in the sky.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.200
The master buys a cow to tie.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.520
Ox hooves, horse feet...

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.680
Madam, when can I call you Mother?

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.592
Soon.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.928
Very soon.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.400
(I must...)

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.160
(I must get the civilian registration)

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.480
(and take you away.)

00:07:29.344 --> 00:07:32.128
(Golden Trauma Ointment)

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.360
(Why am I here?)

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.160
You're awake.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.000
The new rouge is good.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.880
Why didn't you send it to me?

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.680
Jinzhi?

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.400
Why are you here?

00:08:01.952 --> 00:08:03.240
Not just me.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.000
Your mother is also here.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.000
Danxiang.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.160
Mother, what's happening?

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.640
You must save me!

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.560
Save you? How can he save you?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.600
If he had that ability,

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.320
would I be cleaning up your mess?

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.760
Jinzhi, direct your anger at me.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.240
Don't trouble my mother.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.600
Trouble?

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.240
Ask her yourself.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.240
Did I say anything wrong?

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.680
If the Dowager knows about this...

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:52.040
Mother.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.800
Mother, what have you done?

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.960
Speak now!

00:08:56.288 --> 00:08:57.344
I...

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.488
I...

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.496
Fine.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.040
If you won't talk,

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.160
I'll do it.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.168
Shi'an,

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.920
you probably don't know yet.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.280
Master Lu, your father,

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.200
was poisoned by your mother.

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.960
No! I didn't!

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.920
Xia Jinzhi, do you realize

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.120
what you are talking about?

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.560
I know very well.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.000
Back then, Madam Lu used
the Lu family's fortune

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:38.480
to pay her own family's gambling debts.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.880
Later, the deficit grew too large,

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:43.320
and Master Lu discovered it.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.360
He threatened to divorce her
during the confrontation.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.760
So she went all the way,

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.320
murdering her husband

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.520
to silence him.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:01.984
That's not true!

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.800
It wasn't like that!

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.280
I... I just wanted him bedridden
for a few days.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.320
I...

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.160
If I repaid the debt,

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.840
he wouldn't divorce me.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:13.880
I never expected...

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.920
You never expected

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.400
that your medicine would kill him.

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.080
I didn't mean to kill him.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.520
Shi'an.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:24.400
Shi'an, you're my son.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.480
You must trust me.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.320
Trust me.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.480
How do you know this?

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.080
The Xia and Lu families
were longtime allies.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.640
My father also investigated the case.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.880
The truth wasn't hard to uncover.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.560
So your mother begged my father,

00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.040
seeking to unite our families
through marriage,

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.640
and promising me

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.080
to become Lu family's matriarch.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.600
I never expected

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.280
that after finding I cannot conceive,

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.440
she would let
shameless woman bear your child.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.600
Mother,

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.400
is what she says true?

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.680
I did promise you

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.120
to make you
the Lu family's future matriarch.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.800
But who is to blame

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:23.960
when you cannot conceive?

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.896
You...

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.040
Xia Jinzhi!

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.112
Ridiculous!

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.200
Who made me target Ye Qinglan
at every turn,

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.000
claiming that eliminating Ye Qinglan

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.640
would make me the Lu family matriarch?

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.120
And who gave me
the anti-miscarriage medicine,

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.400
making me delay the baby's birth

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.480
to please the Dowager?

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.240
It was you, Madam Lu.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.600
Not me.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.600
It's your own greed

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.840
that kept stalling.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.856
Shut up!

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.280
I want you dead

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.040
to accompany my deceased son.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.880
Xia Jinzhi!

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.760
My son!

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.880
Save...

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.800
Shi'an,

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.264
will you sacrifice a concubine's child

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.160
or ignore your mother's life?

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.400
The choice is yours.

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:46.520
You and Concubine Ye already have Jin.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.040
She will understand.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.560
Xia Jinzhi is coming for you.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.400
Her dirty tricks are just harem schemes.

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.360
She won't move against me openly.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.040
And I'll guard against her tricks.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:24.800
What if Lu Shi'an

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.680
helps her?

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.520
Impossible.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.720
Shi'an wouldn't do that.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.120
I don't believe he'd do this to me.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.240
You won't repent

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.640
until the last minute.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.560
(Will you sacrifice a concubine's child)

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.920
(or ignore your mother's life?
The choice is yours.)

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.920
Lord Shen, A'man.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.640
An emergency!

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.240
Shi'an, what's wrong?

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.360
It's Jin. She...

00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.360
What happened to her?

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.720
Jin suddenly collapsed

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.280
in Jinzhi's chamber.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.232
Jin.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.504
Jin.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.280
Jin.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.080
Jin.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.720
How dare you, a lowly concubine,

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.800
make noise in my chamber?

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.720
This is outrageous!

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:26.960
Where's Jin?

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.680
Where's my daughter?

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.520
Ask him.

00:14:37.056 --> 00:14:37.984
Shi'an,

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.040
you promised me

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.920
no one would lay a finger on Jin.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:46.240
Jin isn't here.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.920
But I swear, she's safe.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.040
Xia Jinzhi, I tolerated you before,

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.720
because you lost your child.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.480
If you harm my child,

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.520
I'll not let you off.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.352
Shi'an,

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.720
take me to Jin.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.680
Let's go find her.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.104
Shi'an.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.760
Shi'an, what are you doing?

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.800
I'm going after my child.
