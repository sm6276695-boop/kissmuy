00:00:06.048 --> 00:00:08.960
=Spring Fever=
=Episode 7=

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.960
Danxiang died in prison.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.440
Okay.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.240
Not surprised?

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.280
Did she reveal anything?

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.960
She didn't say a word.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.320
Just as before,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.040
she took all the blame herself.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.760
Never thought someone like Xia Jinzhi

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.320
would have such a loyal servant.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.200
Not convinced?

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.200
Convinced?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.840
Loyalty is a noble virtue.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.240
What a pity.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.400
A noble person takes revenge

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.880
without hesitation.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.800
You've learned well.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.640
A good blade needs a strong hand

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.760
to charge forward.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.800
Where to strike next?

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.960
People's hearts.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.760
Uncle.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.320
Yes?

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.320
Uncle. Uncle.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.800
Lady Jin, what's wrong?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.840
Uncle, here's some candy for you.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.440
Thank you, Lady Jin.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.120
I brought you a little toy too.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.160
Thank you, uncle. You're amazing!

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.320
Just tell me what you want next time.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.520
Okay.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.320
You've grown taller.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.400
Pakiramdam.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.040
Mother, look.
This uncle made me a toy ox.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.880
So pretty. Did you thank him?

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.080
Oo.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.400
You spend too much each time.
Don't bring her gifts next time.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.120
Just a simple craft from the mountains.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.080
As long as Lady Jin likes it.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.880
Look at you, all sweaty from running.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.240
(You're okay.)

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.240
(That's good.)

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.360
Mother, didn't you promise
to take me back?

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.320
When will that be?

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.920
Jin, be patient for a few more days.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.520
How much longer?

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.160
Halika dito.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.240
Hey.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.320
When you can

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.320
eat properly and sleep on time.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.200
What are you doing here?

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.320
Get out!

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.480
Madam, you haven't been well.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.760
To avoid disturbing your peace,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.520
I'll take Jin to live with me.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.560
What did you say?

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.720
Do you fear I'd harm
my own granddaughter?

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.480
Nonsense!

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.720
I've raised her with the finest care.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.000
If you take her away at will,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.920
what about my dignity?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.680
My daughter is safest with me.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.360
I'd never harm her,

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.560
nor use her as leverage.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.880
What are you implying?

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.160
Are you accusing me of harming Jin?

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.800
Of course not.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.240
You're being paranoid, Jinzhi.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.760
I believe you would never harm Jin.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.720
Though Jin is your blood,

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.880
the matriarch is still the matriarch.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.320
Jinzhi is her rightful mother.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.080
By our presence,

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.280
this household doesn't answer to you.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.040
Then who does this household answer to?

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.040
- Madam.
- Madam.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.720
Mother, why come personally?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.320
I heard of the commotion.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.064
So I came to see for myself.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.000
But I found chaos before entering.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.480
These days,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.880
I've been offering incense
at the ancestral hall.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.400
For three days,

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.240
the incense kept breaking.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.120
It's the ancestors

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.960
blaming you for throwing the household

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.240
into chaos.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.600
It was all this concubine's fault.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.000
It was her.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.360
Sapat na.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.160
When the wife is virtuous,
the husband suffers less.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.480
When the son is filial,
the father feels at ease.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.040
As mothers, as wives, and as concubines,

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.840
you must never let the quarrels
of the inner quarters

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.600
disturb the fortune of the Lu family.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.200
After all,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.440
it is the men who must bear

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.880
the weight of the Lu family's legacy.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.000
Madam,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.560
I just want my daughter back.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.320
Please grant me this wish.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.760
Ye Qinglan,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.000
given your current status,

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.480
Panatilihin si Jin sa iyong tabi,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.560
kung lumabas ang mga salita,

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.320
kapag siya ay lumaki,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.000
mahihirapan siyang
makahanap ng disenteng mapapangasawa.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.560
Kung ikaw

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.680
huwag kang magtiwala na palakihin nila siya,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.920
Isasama ko siya.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.280
ano?

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.720
Wala ka man lang tiwala sakin?

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.800
Salamat sa iyong kabaitan.

00:06:04.032 --> 00:06:06.112
(Prefect's Mansion)

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.360
Walang kwenta!

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.400
Tumatakbo ka umiiyak sa amin
dahil sa kaunting hinaing?

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.760
Pagkatapos ng lahat ng itinuro ko sa iyo,

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.000
hindi mo pa rin kaya
ang walanghiyang babaeng yan?

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.800
ama,

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.960
Patay na si Danxiang.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.680
Walang makakatulong sa akin ngayon.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.320
Ikaw...

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.120
Hindi.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.520
Kung ginamit nang maayos,

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.480
kahit na ang mga patay ay maaaring maging kapaki-pakinabang.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.320
Patay na ba ang lahat sa bahay na ito?

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.960
Hindi mo ba naririnig ang raket na ito?

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.880
aking ginang.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.960
Mga walang kwentang tanga.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.160
Sino ang nagmamalasakit sa kanilang mga numero?

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.560
Buksan ang gate na ito ngayon!

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.480
Itaboy ang mga manggugulo na ito!

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.160
Sino ang tanga

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.280
nangangahas na guluhin ang mga tarangkahan ng pamilya Lu
sa kalaliman ng gabi?

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.640
Sino ang humipo sa akin?

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.960
- My lady, hindi ako iyon.
- Hindi ako iyon.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.280
Walang kapayapaan sa lahat.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.456
Babae, sa likod mo...

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:36.800
anong mali?

00:07:43.584 --> 00:07:44.560
My lady, anong meron?

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.080
anong mali?

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.720
multo!

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.280
multo!

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.120
Inay.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.000
Inay.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.088
Inay, ano ang mali?

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.160
Inay.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.720
anong nangyari?

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.000
Inay.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.480
multo!

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.040
Inay!

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.080
Inay!

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.120
gumising ka na!

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.760
Anong nangyayari dito?

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.000
Madam Lu

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.200
parang possessed.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.040
bakit ka nandito?

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.400
Ang mga kapitbahay ko ay
nagkakagulo.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.320
Paano ako maibubukod dito?

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:39.400
Anong nangyayari dito?

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:43.040
Prefect Xia

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.360
inimbitahan ang Immortal Song
na paalisin ang pamilya Lu.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.760
A-Anong imortal?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.896
Anyayahan ang walang kamatayan?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.400
Oo, anyayahan ang walang kamatayan.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.200
Ang mga nasa tabi ng dagat ay nakatira sa tabi ng dagat.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.160
Kalahati ng kapalaran ng Ningzhou
ay nasa karagatan,

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.640
kalahati sa hangin.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.120
Ang mas hindi mahulaan na kapalaran ay,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.480
mas
lumalakas ang kanilang paniniwala sa mga espiritu.

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.960
Tulad ni Prefect Xia,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.480
Ang Immortal Song ay nanalo
sa puso ng mga tao sa Ningzhou.

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:10.920
Hindi sila sumasamba kay Buddha o Mazu,

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.120
ngunit ilang backwater imortal?

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.840
Paano kaya sina Buddha at Mazu

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.280
kumpara sa walang kamatayang ito

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:20.360
sino ang tumutugtog nito sa pamamagitan ng tainga?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.600
Kaya kong laruin ito sa aking sarili.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.160
Darating siya.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.720
Tingnan mo, ito ay Immortal Song.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.240
tumahimik ka! wag ka magsalita.

00:09:39.616 --> 00:09:42.880
(Lu Residence)

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.120
(Mukhang)

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.000
(hinahabol na naman nila ang kawawang kaluluwa
sa tabi ko.)

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.560
Dumating ang Immortal Song.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.280
Nagsimula na ang lahat ng kasamaan.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.600
Manalangin nang buong taimtim.

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.520
Itaboy ang kasawian.

00:10:12.717 --> 00:10:15.757
???Gilingin ang laman sa pagitan ng grit at bato???

00:10:17.869 --> 00:10:22.189
???Lumabog sa sakit,
saka lang ipinanganak ang mga perlas???

00:10:25.581 --> 00:10:29.485
???Maghintay hanggang mabahiran ng abyssal darkness
ang bawat pulgada ng balat???

00:10:31.629 --> 00:10:36.685
???Pagkatapos dumating ang oras upang habulin ang bukang-liwayway???

00:10:39.277 --> 00:10:43.885
???Magwawalis ako sa maalikabok na buhangin???

00:10:44.493 --> 00:10:47.469
???Nagpapahangin???
