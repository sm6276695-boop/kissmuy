=Lust and Lies=

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.240
(Cheng, Adjutant)
That woman came for the Lion Seal, right?

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:52.320
Young Marshal,

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:53.840
she hurt you.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.399
She's no ordinary woman.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.620
=Episode 2=

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:28.680
What's your name, Miss?

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:33.359
Yan Qing.

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:50.519
We barely know each other,
Young Marshal.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.159
Isn't it

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:54.840
a bit forward of you?

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:00.519
We barely know each other?

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.000
Have you forgotten

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:08.639
that just a few days ago,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.759
you were flirting with me?

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.639
I don't understand

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.919
what you're talking about.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.639
Could it be

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.919
that you

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.599
saw me in a dream?

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.159
I heard the Qingfang Troupe you worked with

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.759
caught fire a few days ago.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.080
Yet you're in one piece.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.159
Yes.

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.879
That day,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:45.800
the building caught fire,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.840
and many were killed.

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:48.560
I was fortunate.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.560
A young lady saved me.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.039
Which young lady?

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:00.039
A woman

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.520
dressed as the character Bai Suzhen.

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:09.360
Now that you're in the Huo Residence,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.360
I'll be watching you.

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:16.120
Thank you for your attention,
Young Marshal.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.039
Young Marshal,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.490
the birthday banquet is about to begin.

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.560
This way, please.

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:58.199
Look.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.719
Look at that.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.719
There they are.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.780
Congratulations, Marshal Huo.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.830
Congratulations, Marshal Huo.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.800
Congratulations.

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.790
Congratulations, Marshal Huo.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.079
Her pipa playing is good.

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.319
(Liu Qing, First Madam Huo. Liu Yiyi, adopted daughter)
I haven't seen her before.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.920
Aunt,

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:06.560
she just came here

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:09.079
with the Qingfang Troupe from Sucheng.

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:10.680
Of course, you haven't seen her.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.000
Miss Yan Qing is renowned
for her pipa playing.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.220
Many have offered high prices for it.

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:15.639
She is

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.079
mysterious.

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.720
Few have seen her face.

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:19.800
This time,

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:22.360
I specially invited her
to celebrate your birthday.

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:24.600
You're so thoughtful.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.680
As long as you're pleased,

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.560
I'm willing to do anything for you.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:30.759
Didn't the Qingfang Troupe

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.480
disappear

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.680
after a big fire?

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:34.959
I've checked on

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:36.160
this Miss Yan Qing.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.839
Someone rescued her.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.000
If Qingwan were still here...

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:44.560
Today is a happy day.

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:47.240
Let's not talk about this.

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:06.199
Excellent!

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.960
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.839
Miss Yan Qing, your hat dropped.

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:54.680
I'm here to return it.

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:06.360
You must be kidding, Young Marshal.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.560
This is a man's hat.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.240
How could it be mine?

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:12.920
Are you sure?

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:35.160
Your wound has split open.

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:36.759
Go get it bandaged.

00:07:37.319 --> 00:07:38.240
I'm going to change clothes.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:42.600
What are you trying to do now?

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.199
I'll help you.

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:53.800
Do what I say,

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:56.839
and I might consider
stabbing you somewhere else.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:14.519
How did you

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:16.959
get that wound?

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:18.920
This is

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:20.319
none of your business.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:22.879
Aunt.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.480
Where are you going, Aunt?

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.279
Aunt.

00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:30.959
Everyone in the Qingfang Troupe died,

00:08:31.959 --> 00:08:34.399
but you disguised yourself as Yan Qing

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:35.679
and entered the Huo Residence.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.559
Should I call you stupid

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.679
or bold?

00:08:43.759 --> 00:08:45.440
I don't understand what you mean.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.960
Could you

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:48.960
have set that fire?

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.960
If this is your game,

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:03.879
I'll play along.

00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:10.440
Let go of me!

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.100
What are you doing, Young Marshal?

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:13.080
Let go of me!

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:14.399
What are you doing?

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:29.960
First Madam.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.840
Girl,

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:33.759
is this jade pendant

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:35.879
yours?

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.679
Yes, it's mine.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.200
I don't remember much from childhood,

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.519
but this jade pendant

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.679
has been with me.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:49.960
Aunt,

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:52.399
this is only a jade pendant.

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.200
Perhaps

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.399
it's just similar.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.360
How did you get that scar

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:58.759
on your back?

00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:02.240
I had it since I was little.

00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:04.519
I can't remember

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.320
what happened.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.159
You fell

00:10:09.799 --> 00:10:11.080
from a horse

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.600
and scrapped it.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.879
How do you know?

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:17.799
Because

00:10:18.799 --> 00:10:20.759
you're my daughter,

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:22.960
Qingwan.

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:24.799
Qingwan.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.279
Qingwan.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.360
Qingwan.

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:29.919
Qingwan.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.639
My Qingwan.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.879
Miss Yiyi,

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.399
what's the big hurry?

00:10:45.399 --> 00:10:46.250
Where are you rushing off?

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.519
Someone entered the Huo Residence
with bad intentions.

00:10:49.759 --> 00:10:51.240
I must tell Uncle.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.399
Who would dare?

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.480
The performer you brought in,

00:10:59.879 --> 00:11:01.000
Yan Qing.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:08.380
(Sheng Weilian,
Young Master of the Sheng family)

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.759
The good show

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.840
is finally about to begin.
