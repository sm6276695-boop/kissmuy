[Between Love and Frost]

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.020
[Episode 6]

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.150
What are you doing?

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.390
Come out with me!

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.200
What were you doing

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.230
with her in the room?

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:23.840
It's a misunderstanding.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.760
Just for fun!

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.560
For fun?

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.760
You'll succeed me as Military Governor
in a few days.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.310
If you stir up any trouble

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.150
in the coming days,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.350
you'll ruin yourself. You know?

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.280
I told you

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.760
I don't want to be a Military Governor.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.120
You have no choice!

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.200
I took pity on Ce

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.680
and adopted him from the slums.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.430
He's just a disposable life.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.590
You are different.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.400
You're my real son.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.400
You must embrace your fortune.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.590
Say whatever you want.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.310
I'll walk my own path.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.200
Walk away if you dare,

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.560
I will kill that woman.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.000
If you kill her,

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.000
upon my accession,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.430
I'll strip Jiang City of its military authority.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.280
Without this warlord leader,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.430
the civilian will be happier.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.840
Pei!

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.360
You've truly seen me as an outsider.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.560
I want you to stop Gu Tongpei's

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.470
succession ceremony in the coming days.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.360
I have news of Chu Huaixuan.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.590
Go ahead.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.080
He'll escape from the city.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.630
Your two actions before

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.870
have alerted him.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.000
You know how cowardly he is.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.680
When will you hand him over to me?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.000
Kill Gu Tongpei first.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.280
I won't kill him.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.660
But I have another way

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.820
to destroy the ceremony.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.560
My connections can acquire drugs

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.080
to induce prolonged unconsciousness.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.150
Once Gu Rongchong fainted,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.080
the ceremony won't proceed as well.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.710
Right after this,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.680
I must see

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.560
Chu Huaixuan.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.240
Deal.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.120
Flowers!

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.080
Flowers!

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.340
[Feng's Shop]

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.870
Flowers!

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:12.840
Do you want flowers?

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.750
Buy one, please.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.120
No need.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.360
Would you join me for dinner?

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.270
Let's have a talk.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.920
Nothing to talk about between us.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.920
I didn't finish my words last night.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.870
But I made it clear last night.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.950
I have things to attend to.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:32.830
Please leave.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.070
And if you keep pestering me,

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.830
we'll become enemies.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.920
Chu Minghui,

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.920
you just work with Tongce

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.600
to use each other, right?

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.190
Flowers!

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.720
Flowers!

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.800
Get some flowers?

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.800
No.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.430
Sir, do you want flowers?

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.630
This...

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.560
That's between him and me.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:13.630
None of your business.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.800
If you don't make it clear today,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.600
I'll keep pestering you.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.190
You!

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.190
Flowers!

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.630
Miss, do you want to buy one?

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.750
Buy one, please.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.000
Miss.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.630
Okay.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.920
Keep the change.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.120
Yeah. Thank you.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.430
Nice flowers!

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.160
I bought them for her,

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.190
yet you wanted to take them away.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.070
You gave it to me,

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.190
so I can give it to whoever I want.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.190
I bought them.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.390
You can't just give them to anyone.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.240
Tongpei,

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.390
just some flowers.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.800
I'll take care of the bill.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.160
But

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.360
I hope you'll show some discretion.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.630
Since she is my girlfriend,

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.040
it only makes sense
if I give her flowers.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.750
Let go!

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.560
As you both think they're pretty,

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.240
let's use them as decorations tomorrow.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.680
That's settled then.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.800
Just waiting for tomorrow's succession.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.920
All is Gu Tongpei's fault.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.680
Even my mealtime was messed up!

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.830
What do you want here?

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.360
Just have a look.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.630
Take your time then.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.190
Hungry?

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.480
No.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.870
Then what are you looking for?

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.310
Just have a look.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:06.950
Want half?

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.390
Let's share this.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.310
Actually, I just wanted to help you.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.560
Tomorrow is the succession ceremony.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.390
Pig out now

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:23.600
and your face might puff up.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.310
I'll take more off your bowl.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.150
Thanks.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.360
Finished?

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.870
I'm full.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:14.670
I'll head out now.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.080
I can't finish it anyway.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.390
Here, have a little.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.750
I don't want to waste food.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.750
Sorry, Gu Tongpei.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:41.630
I'm going to break our promise tomorrow.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.750
Thank you!

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.390
Let's keep in touch more.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:07.600
Pei.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.630
Mr. Gu.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.840
Sun, Liu,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.320
let me introduce.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.960
This is my son, Gu Tongpei.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.670
Please give him your support.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.390
What a distinguished look!

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.840
Go ahead and tend to other tasks.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:28.790
I'll take care of this.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:29.440
Yes.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.200
Excuse me for now.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:40.840
Okay.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.200
Please give Pei

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:45.030
your support from now on.

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:46.320
Well, cheers.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.550
You have skillful hands.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.240
Did I startle you?

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.550
Why are you here?

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.360
To take a break.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:15.750
If I drink one of them,

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:16.870
you won't tattle on me, huh?

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:20.200
Drink this.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.270
If you drink too much,

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:22.840
your father will scold you.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.150
Drink and go back.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.960
The ceremony starts soon.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.080
I didn't want to take the title.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.120
But now I've realized

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.000
if that title would make you

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:44.200
believe that I can help you,

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.320
then I'll take it.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.480
You've been at it for a while.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:26.550
Take a break.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.840
I'll handle this.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.440
Tao.

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:37.600
Mr. Gu.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.080
Take this glass of wine to Tongpei.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.790
Yes.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.840
Dear guests,

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:55.790
thank you for your presence.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:57.600
I'd like to propose a toast.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:59.960
Once he drinks it,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.270
he'll faint immediately.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.960
When will I meet Chu Huaixuan?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.480
Rest assured. I won't break my promise.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.750
Why hasn't he fainted yet?

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.440
Today, I've gathered you all here

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.080
to announce something really important.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.550
Before sharing it,

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.600
I propose

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.360
we toast

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:26.360
to my son, Gu Tongpei,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.600
because today

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.600
holds

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.150
profound significance for him.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.360
You switched the wine.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.700
But it ends up at the same point.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.100
Raise your glasses!

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.060
Come on, everyone!

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.020
Cheers!

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.460
Think clearly. This is your only chance.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.780
Please take care of me.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:52.620
Rest assured.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.700
I'll keep my promise.

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:40.980
You!

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:43.380
Mr. Gu.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:43.860
Father.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:44.300
Mr. Gu.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.020
Father.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:45.740
Father.

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:46.660
He had a stroke!

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.300
Father!

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:48.820
Someone.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.580
Go to the hospital!

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:53.380
She hooked up with Tongpei.

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:53.900
What a disgrace!

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.540
Mr. Gu was so furious and collapsed.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.580
She is nothing but trouble!

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.020
Who is she?

00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.220
She has clung to Tongce.

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.620
How dare she try to seduce Tongpei?

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:04.940
Sorry, Gu Tongpei.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:08.100
This is the only way I can save you.
