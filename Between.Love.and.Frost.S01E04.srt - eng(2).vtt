[Between Love and Frost]

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.020
[Episode 4]

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.560
I could have killed you with that shot.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.160
But I didn't.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.720
Consider it as repaying what I owed you.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.320
Say it straight.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.920
On a snowy day seven or eight years ago,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.040
you saved me on the old street
in the north.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.560
Do you remember?

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.360
Are you okay?

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.440
Your hands are frostbitten.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.760
Let me warm them for you.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.360
That way they won't hurt.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.360
My men,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.360
I saved each of them.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.500
I've saved too many lives.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.520
As for you,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.600
I don't recall.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.560
You're not a bad person.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.720
I don't know why you want to kill me.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.600
All I hope is

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.720
that you don't get involved

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.440
in the conflict
between me and Gu Tongce.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.480
Will you?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.800
You!

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.200
Today,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.360
I must give my partner an explanation.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.800
Go.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.360
I need time to consider your words.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.040
Thank you.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.760
Pei.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.000
Father,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.080
you're back.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.360
You...

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.160
Ouch!

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.560
Did you mess around

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.360
again?

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.720
Father, I can't talk now.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.960
I need to hurry upstairs
and bandage this.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.200
Such a worry.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.120
Father, I'll talk to Tongpei.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.040
Please don't get angry.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.400
Is this how you take care
of your brother?

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.160
He got injured today.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.520
Tomorrow he might get killed.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.240
Listen carefully.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.920
If Tongpei

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.920
ever gets hurt again,

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.800
I will hold you accountable.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.840
Understood, Father.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.080
Chu Minghui,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.640
why isn't Gu Tongpei dead yet?

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.440
He was prepared.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.360
I fell into his ambush
while still injured

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.920
and barely managed to escape.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.320
Being still injured

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.360
is no excuse for your failing.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.200
I've done my utmost for your matter.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.800
So when will you

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.720
show a little sincerity?

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.000
What,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.640
you want to test my ability?

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.700
[Palace of Joy]

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.240
That's the person you want.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.680
No doubts

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.600
about my ability anymore, right?

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.560
You haven't finished what I asked.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.160
You can do nothing about him.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.560
Don't cause me trouble tonight.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.680
As long as you command, Mr. Chu,

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.200
we'll do as you say.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.440
We'll rely on you

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.760
to lead us to good money.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.120
We're businessmen.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.720
We can surely make money together.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.200
Exactly.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.560
Mr. Chu.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.840
It's been a while.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.920
Good evening, Mr. Gu.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.800
This is Chu Minghui, my girlfriend.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.320
Mr. Gu's girlfriend?

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.360
Quite pretty.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.920
Mr. Chu, I've heard a lot about you.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.360
You look familiar, Miss Chu.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.760
Perhaps we've met before.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.400
Why are they still alive?

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.640
Leave no one alive.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.120
I happen to be running
a small business.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.560
Hopefully, we can work together.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.680
We'll see.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.160
What business can a woman even do?

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.280
Exactly.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.280
She's only made it here

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.000
thanks to the Governor's Mansion.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.240
She wants to steal spotlight from men.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.760
She really doesn't know her place.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.160
Why can't women do business?

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.960
The army's supply chain

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.840
has been corrupted.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.840
I'm looking to change suppliers.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.160
I wonder

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.640
if you would be interested.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.740
Of course.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.760
We can discuss the details later.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:24.600
You are here too.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.780
If I'd known you were here,

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.240
I would have brought my lawyer

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.400
to finalize the termination issue.

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:35.600
You've been our suppliers for long.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.800
Still make such rookie mistakes?

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:42.920
See,

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:44.720
men and women

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.320
are not that different.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.240
What matters is character and ability.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.520
Those welcomed by the Governor's Mansion

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.640
are no ordinary people.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.720
My sister-in-law

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.560
doesn't bask
in Tongce's or the Mansion's glory.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.560
She deserves it in her own right.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.320
Tongce,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.040
I have matters to discuss with Minghui.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.000
I'd like to introduce her
to some business partners.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.560
Sounds good.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.880
Go ahead.

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.000
Seize the chance.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.840
What was Mr. Gu thinking?

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.640
All this just for a woman?

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.960
Why did you speak up for me?

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.760
I've been fed up

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.440
with those old geezers.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.760
So you didn't do that for me.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.320
Seems I overthought it.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.560
Stay still.

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.080
Keep quiet.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.320
Hand over anything valuable on you.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:11.920
Ow!

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:12.960
It hurts.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.240
Sorry,

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.560
I don't have a single penny.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:18.040
All I've got is this worthless life.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.160
Take it if you want.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.000
You're still that sharp.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.600
Sorry, beauty.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.560
Excuse us.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.800
Show some respect.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.840
Don't call her that.

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:29.960
This is my sister-in-law.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.400
Aren't you on bad terms
with your brother?

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:34.720
Why...

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.800
Yes, with my brother,

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.960
not my sister-in-law.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.720
Don't try guilt by association.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.800
Come on, let's talk inside.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.360
Let's go.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.560
Why are you standing there?

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.160
You might actually be able to help.

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.800
The Central Plains have suffered
a severe drought this year.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.920
The people are in misery.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.160
We can't just stand by and do nothing.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.320
Pei, we've raised some donations.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.680
If exchanged for supplies,

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.760
it can keep them going for a while.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.960
But the problem is,

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.120
how can we make sure these supplies

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.040
reach the people intact?

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.320
True. Corruption infects everything
these times,

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.560
let alone such rich supplies.

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.780
My old man won't lend military trucks

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.780
to let me cross
into another governor's territory.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.420
But without army escorts,

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:41.940
how can we

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.540
deliver the supplies intact?

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.380
That's right.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.060
Yeah, what should we do?

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:50.940
You're not a bad person.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.020
All I hope is

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.260
that you don't get involved

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:55.140
in the conflict
between me and Gu Tongce.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.660
Thank you.

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.140
You haven't finished what I asked.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:04.620
You can do nothing about him.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:06.220
Yes, with my brother,

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:07.420
not my sister-in-law.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.060
Don't try guilt by association.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:19.940
I'll let you go for now.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.580
I'll kill Chu Huaixuan tonight
by myself.

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.020
Back when I did
the grain and oil business,

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.460
I traveled the Central Plains

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.140
and met some contacts.

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.580
But as you know,

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.780
those connections

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.620
always cost money to smooth.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:34.980
If you don't mind,

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:37.740
I can introduce them to you.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:38.940
That makes sense.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.180
These days,

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.780
it's good enough if money can solve it.

00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:43.860
Thank you, Minghui.

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:46.220
Here, let's toast to Minghui.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:47.500
- Sure.
- Okay.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.140
- To Minghui.
- To Minghui.

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:01.860
I'll reach out to them now.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.660
Okay.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.660
You've helped us so much.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.780
When will you join the organization?

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:18.820
Come on.

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:19.860
Come on.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:09.140
Madam, I'll go have a look.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:10.740
Follow me.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.260
People in the car, hands up! Get out!

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:35.940
Mr. Chu,

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:38.340
the Director reminded you
to strengthen security tonight.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.380
Si!

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:57.860
Madam, it's an ambush!

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.340
Take Madam away now.

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:22.660
Take Madam away now!

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.780
Watch out, Madam!

00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:42.140
Madam!

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.540
Don't let Si die in vain. Move!

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:46.580
Move!

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.500
Split up!

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.100
Why did you try to assassinate Chu?

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.460
What does that have to do with you?

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.300
Why did you save me?

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.540
I owed you a life.

00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:22.660
Silly.
