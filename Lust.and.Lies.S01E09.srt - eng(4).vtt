=Lust and Lies=

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:41.479
You're only coming back now?

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:51.920
How's your injury?

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.159
You've certainly nailed that part

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.240
at the festival.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.990
You were just stalling with me,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:05.799
playing along,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.120
then had those people come after me,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.359
didn't you?

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:14.840
I don't know those people.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.000
Are you still trying to lie to me?

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.079
I saw with my own eyes
that you gave the order.

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:23.799
Those assassins were protecting you

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.280
but closing in on me at every step.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.760
Then why would you be
dumb enough to save me?

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.159
You're right.

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:37.319
I was stupid.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.840
Because I was afraid I was wrong,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.200
and those people would really hurt you.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.359
Young Marshal Huo, Governor wants to see you.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.280
When Young Marshal Huo was unconscious,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.599
he gave me this nine-linked ring

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.960
and told me to redeem the prize.

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:14.280
He said it was for you.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.719
I've never seen him
care about anyone like this.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.800
I'm only his sister.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.020

Was there anything strange?

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:12.620
There was nothing unusual.

I'm just the watchdog he raised.

I should go.

00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:15.679
Did you know all along
she was Huo Qingwan?

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.919
You said you were her fan

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:27.039
and even asked me to invite her
to my aunt's birthday banquet.

00:09:28.039 --> 00:09:29.120
I thought

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:31.200
you were just helping me

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.759
win my aunt's favor.

00:09:34.039 --> 00:09:34.679
That's right.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.879
You found

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.879
Madam Huo's real daughter.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:41.759
Doesn't this put you

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.600
in a better position
within the Huo family?

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.639
A better position?

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:52.879
I've lived as an outsider
in the Huo family for all these years.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.240
I thought my struggles
were finally over.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.559
But you had me
send Huo Qingwan back with my own hands.

00:10:01.919 --> 00:10:02.720
Don't be upset.

00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:05.240
Huo Qingwan returning

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:06.360
to the Huo family

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:08.799
benefits all of us.

00:10:09.039 --> 00:10:11.039
It only benefits the Sheng family,
doesn't it?

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:14.000
I've done so much for you

00:10:14.879 --> 00:10:16.639
all these years.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.559
You're not allowed to love anyone else.

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:22.200
You must marry me

00:10:22.559 --> 00:10:24.559
and make me
the young madam of the Sheng family.
