00:01:35.208 --> 00:01:36.875
Sir, are you here for a checkup?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.791
Is the doctor in?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.916
I'm here to see the doctor.

00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:46.083
Sir, please come with me.

00:01:58.208 --> 00:01:58.791
Please have a seat.

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:06.250
Where are you feeling unwell?

00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:08.666
My stomach hurts every night lately.

00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:11.375
Did you eat something unusual?

00:02:12.458 --> 00:02:14.208
Steamed pufferfish, fragrant and tender,

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:21.875
Its liver lingers like amber’s glow.

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:27.625
Jiaqi reporting to the organization.

00:02:33.583 --> 00:02:34.416
The dragon has landed.

00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:37.375
Operation Dawn is officially underway.

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:43.333
Sit.

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:43.791
Alright.

00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:49.500
By the way,

00:02:49.958 --> 00:02:51.583
Was your journey here smooth?

00:02:53.666 --> 00:02:54.833
Security checks were strict all the way.

00:02:57.708 --> 00:02:58.541
That's a good thing.

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:00.333
Why?

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:03.041
It means the enemy

00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:03.875
is afraid of us now.

00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:06.333
Makes sense.

00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:07.375
Oh.

00:03:10.625 --> 00:03:12.416
This is what the higher-ups asked me to give you.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.833
What happened?

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:22.541
Ah.

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:25.250
We were ambushed.

00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:26.583
Brother Dong.

00:03:27.208 --> 00:03:28.208
He was killed.

00:03:30.583 --> 00:03:33.291
The operative file was stolen too.

00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:34.916
Who did it?

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:36.416
Huojinshan.

00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:40.500
Him again.

00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:43.583
Quick, come with me.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.625
Hurry!

00:03:49.791 --> 00:03:50.583
Careful, careful.

00:04:07.708 --> 00:04:08.375
This is bad.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.708
That file contains the names of over a hundred operatives.

00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:13.958
And more than twenty

00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:15.583
substation hideouts.

00:04:16.583 --> 00:04:17.500
What do we do now?

00:04:18.583 --> 00:04:19.791
Who is this person?

00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:23.791
A key member of the Bureau of Secrets Jiangbei Liaison Office.

00:04:23.916 --> 00:04:24.916
He’s committed many crimes.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.583
He’s harmed many of our operatives.

00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:36.416
In that case,

00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:37.958
Operation Dawn

00:04:38.458 --> 00:04:39.250
will start with him.

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:40.625
Alright.

00:04:51.375 --> 00:04:52.208

00:04:52.583 --> 00:04:53.833

Freshly steamed buns.

00:05:13.083 --> 00:05:13.583
Brother Jinshan.

00:05:14.416 --> 00:05:14.958
Stop!

00:05:16.791 --> 00:05:17.500
Don’t run!

00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:18.875
Stop! Stop!

00:05:19.125 --> 00:05:19.666
Stop!

00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:22.708
Don’t run!

00:05:28.666 --> 00:05:29.250
Stop!

00:05:29.916 --> 00:05:30.541
Don’t run!

00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:31.166
Stop!

00:05:41.416 --> 00:05:42.541
Why are you running?

00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:43.583
Ah.

00:05:45.416 --> 00:05:45.833
Gentlemen.

00:05:46.416 --> 00:05:46.958
Brother.

00:05:47.416 --> 00:05:48.166
Officer.

00:05:49.458 --> 00:05:50.416
You’ve got the wrong person, haven’t you?

00:05:51.416 --> 00:05:52.333
How could that be?

00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:54.041
Director Deng.

00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:55.833
Director Deng sent us to pick you up.

00:05:57.083 --> 00:05:57.625
This time,

00:05:58.166 --> 00:05:59.291
you’ve done a great service.

00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:01.041
Director Deng.

00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:05.666
Listen to me, hey—

00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:06.083
Don’t be like that.

00:06:06.916 --> 00:06:07.666
Don’t grip so tight.

00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:08.166
Hurry up.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.791
I’ll talk, I’ll talk.

00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:09.958
Alright, alright.

00:06:10.458 --> 00:06:10.916
Everyone.

00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:12.125
Slow down.

00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:13.375
Where are we going?

00:06:14.625 --> 00:06:15.000
This—

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:15.541
This—

00:07:02.041 --> 00:07:02.666
Brother Jinshan

00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:07.583
Brother Jinshan

00:07:08.416 --> 00:07:09.000
You'll know once you go in.

00:07:20.625 --> 00:07:21.333
Brother Jinshan,

00:07:21.416 --> 00:07:21.541
Mm.

00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:23.166
Don't be nervous.

00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:23.541
Mm.

00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:25.041
Here,

00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:26.083
this is our place.

00:07:26.083 --> 00:07:27.500
It's absolutely safe.

00:07:28.208 --> 00:07:29.041
Just wait a bit.

00:07:29.708 --> 00:07:30.333
Director Deng

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:31.416
He'll be here soon.

00:07:33.583 --> 00:07:34.791
Director Deng

00:07:35.541 --> 00:07:36.125
Yes.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.875
Director Deng Fengsheng from the Bureau of Secrets.

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:40.833
Of course.

00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.083
From our Bureau of Secrets.

00:07:43.083 --> 00:07:43.791
That Deng Fengsheng.

00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:44.333
Director Deng.

00:07:44.958 --> 00:07:46.083
Who else would it be?

00:07:46.458 --> 00:07:47.000
Come, come.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Sit, sit, sit.

00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:55.666
I've heard of him too.

00:07:57.541 --> 00:07:59.541
I'm just a low-level operative.

00:07:59.708 --> 00:08:02.000
I've always been stationed in Jiangbei.

00:08:03.083 --> 00:08:05.125
How could I know such a high-ranking officer?

00:08:07.333 --> 00:08:07.875
Brother Jinshan,

00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:08.458
Mm.

00:08:08.583 --> 00:08:10.041
Today, you've done a great service for the Party and the Nation.

00:08:10.208 --> 00:08:11.208
You've made a major contribution.

00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:12.958
When Director Deng arrives,

00:08:13.416 --> 00:08:15.083
he'll surely reward you.

00:08:15.541 --> 00:08:16.458
Don't worry.

00:08:17.083 --> 00:08:17.791
Right.

00:08:18.208 --> 00:08:19.083
You won't be left out.

00:08:19.208 --> 00:08:19.541
Ah.

00:08:19.541 --> 00:08:20.458
You won't be left out.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.833
Why did you run just now?

00:08:30.708 --> 00:08:31.625
How would I know?

00:08:31.625 --> 00:08:33.583
I didn't know you were Director Deng's people.

00:08:36.083 --> 00:08:37.375
Sorry if I offended you earlier.

00:08:37.458 --> 00:08:38.833
Brother Jinshan, please forgive me.

00:08:39.166 --> 00:08:39.666
Here, have a cigarette.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.125
Please have some tea.

00:08:43.458 --> 00:08:44.166
Let me light it for you.

00:08:54.208 --> 00:08:55.125
Brother Jinshan,

00:08:55.125 --> 00:08:55.625
Oh.

00:08:55.625 --> 00:08:56.791
Section Chief Huo

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:57.833
From now on,

00:08:58.375 --> 00:08:59.333
please look after me.

00:08:59.791 --> 00:09:00.916
Please look after me.

00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:03.666
Of course.

00:09:04.958 --> 00:09:07.833
Even among our own people,

00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:10.833
we still have to follow the rules.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.375
Right?

00:09:11.375 --> 00:09:12.083
Yes.

00:09:12.375 --> 00:09:15.625
You called out "Brother Jinshan" as soon as you arrived.

00:09:15.791 --> 00:09:17.625
How could I not bolt?

00:09:18.625 --> 00:09:19.833
We agreed on

00:09:20.583 --> 00:09:22.041
two whistles and two shouts.

00:09:22.708 --> 00:09:23.958
But you didn't do any.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.791
Things are so tense now.

00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:27.458
How could I dare, right?

00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:29.583
Section Chief Huo,

00:09:29.791 --> 00:09:31.541
This is our first time handling something this big.

00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:34.083
We got nervous and forgot everything.

00:09:34.333 --> 00:09:35.833
Forgot it all, totally forgot.

00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:37.125
No need to be nervous.

00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:38.875
You'll have me from now on.

00:09:39.583 --> 00:09:40.500
Of course, of course.

00:09:41.041 --> 00:09:41.666
I'll take care of you.

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:44.333
Thank you in advance, Section Chief Huo.

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:44.833
Thank you, Section Chief Huo.

00:09:45.416 --> 00:09:46.250
Sit, sit.

00:09:46.416 --> 00:09:47.250
Have some tea.

00:09:48.833 --> 00:09:49.125
Sit, sit.

00:09:49.791 --> 00:09:51.166
I know them all.

00:09:51.791 --> 00:09:53.041
Just introduce them one by one.

00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:00.541
Director Deng

00:10:00.541 --> 00:10:01.125
Hello.

00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:02.625
I'm Huojinshan.

00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:03.875
Stationed in Shatou Town.

00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:05.166
Intelligence operative.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.875
Oh.

00:10:10.208 --> 00:10:11.500
Please sit.

00:10:17.666 --> 00:10:18.500
Brother Jinshan

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.416
Thank you for your hard work.

00:10:19.791 --> 00:10:20.583
Not at all.

00:10:20.583 --> 00:10:22.666
I just heard the news myself.

00:10:23.291 --> 00:10:25.208
You did an excellent job this time.

00:10:26.333 --> 00:10:27.625
The higher-ups have given orders.

00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:30.208
You are appointed Deputy Section Chief of Action Division Two.

00:10:30.541 --> 00:10:32.208
Four gold bars as a reward.

00:10:35.375 --> 00:10:36.791
Thank you for your patronage, Director Deng.

00:10:37.166 --> 00:10:39.875
I will remain loyal to the Party and the Nation.

00:10:40.458 --> 00:10:41.166
Where are the items?

00:10:42.166 --> 00:10:43.000
The items?

00:10:43.875 --> 00:10:45.333
Such valuable items,

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.416
How could I possibly

00:10:46.541 --> 00:10:47.541
carry them with me?

00:10:47.666 --> 00:10:48.541
I kept them at my house.

00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:50.083
Everything is well arranged.

00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:50.875
Or,

00:10:50.875 --> 00:10:52.000
I can bring them to you now.

00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:54.791
Everyone is hunting you right now.

00:10:54.791 --> 00:10:56.500
It's not safe for you to go.

00:10:56.791 --> 00:10:58.041
Let them go instead.

00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:00.458
That's fine.

00:11:01.041 --> 00:11:02.375
Recently, my wife and kids

00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:03.166
have been staying in the countryside.

00:11:03.166 --> 00:11:04.083
No one is at home.

00:11:04.791 --> 00:11:05.541
And the items?

00:11:05.541 --> 00:11:06.791
They're in my backyard.

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:09.000
Inside the hidden compartment in the wardrobe.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.250
Just open the wardrobe,

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.458
count from the bottom,

00:11:12.625 --> 00:11:13.625
the eighth compartment.

00:11:14.083 --> 00:11:15.041
You'll see it.

00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:21.458
Have a seat.

00:11:29.666 --> 00:11:30.666
Brother Jinshan,

00:11:31.833 --> 00:11:34.041
Is this intelligence reliable?

00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:37.458
Where did you get it?

00:11:38.708 --> 00:11:40.583
No one else has seen it, right?

00:11:42.041 --> 00:11:43.375
This is no small matter.

00:11:44.625 --> 00:11:46.541
Once the military moves,

00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:50.458
if the intelligence is wrong,

00:11:51.708 --> 00:11:53.333
it'll be a big problem.

00:11:54.916 --> 00:11:55.625
Director Deng,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.291
I risked my life to get this.

00:11:59.125 --> 00:12:01.041
I even killed a Communist for it.

00:12:02.333 --> 00:12:03.333
I guarantee

00:12:03.875 --> 00:12:05.541
this intelligence is absolutely accurate.

00:12:06.333 --> 00:12:07.541
If it's false,

00:12:07.541 --> 00:12:07.958
you

00:12:08.625 --> 00:12:10.000
can execute me on the spot.

00:12:13.375 --> 00:12:14.500
Have some water first.

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.875
Take a rest.

00:12:16.875 --> 00:12:18.541
We'll move you to a safer place tonight.

00:12:25.125 --> 00:12:27.541
I'd better not drink.

00:12:34.291 --> 00:12:34.666
Jiaqi,

00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:38.250
Did you find the items?

00:12:40.458 --> 00:12:41.041
Yes, I found them.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:42.208
I've checked everything.

00:12:42.291 --> 00:12:42.791
No problems.

00:12:44.333 --> 00:12:44.833
Everything's here.

00:12:44.833 --> 00:12:46.541
Yes, that's right.

00:19:30.583 --> 00:19:32.000
Thank you, Director Deng, for your patronage.
