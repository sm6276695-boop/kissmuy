00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:26.500
Everyone,

00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:29.625
The tide has turned.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.333
We must plan ahead.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.541
Is it really this serious?

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:35.583
Rumors disturbing the troops.

00:01:36.625 --> 00:01:37.958
Where did they come from?

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:42.750
Hmm.

00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:02.291
The Commander is very angry now.

00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:05.291
Everyone knows.

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:09.875
If we don't get to the bottom of this,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.875
no one leaves.

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:20.833
Don't move.

00:02:21.625 --> 00:02:22.208
Stay still.

00:02:23.208 --> 00:02:23.791
Put down your gun.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.625
Put down your gun.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.125
My own child.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.416
It's not your place to act out here.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.166
Commander Wang.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.458
As long as the leader isn't corrupt, the ranks won't be either.

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:55.333
Then I have an explanation.

00:02:57.125 --> 00:02:58.041
Director Deng, please

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:00.166
rest in the VIP room.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.583
Please.

00:03:10.291 --> 00:03:10.625
Let's go.

00:03:18.708 --> 00:03:19.500
Everyone here

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.750
is a brother who has fought life and death with me.

00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:24.250
You all know

00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:27.500
the leader and the Party and the Nation have treated us well.

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:28.666
Speak up.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.291
What is this all about today?

00:03:34.916 --> 00:03:36.208
The Commander personally raised me.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.583
You can execute me today.

00:03:40.083 --> 00:03:40.916
The game is up.

00:03:41.416 --> 00:03:42.666
This is all out in the open.

00:03:43.875 --> 00:03:45.083
If we don't plan ahead,

00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:46.750
who will?

00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:49.958
Go to Taiwan, China.

00:03:50.791 --> 00:03:52.208
What can we do there?

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:54.791
What about our wives and children?

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.250
Brothers,

00:04:05.083 --> 00:04:08.333
since fighting against the Japanese invaders, we've risked our lives together.

00:04:10.666 --> 00:04:12.625
Though I'm your Commander,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.416
I'm also your elder brother.

00:04:17.916 --> 00:04:19.166
Today I've made a decision.

00:04:20.708 --> 00:04:22.083
The 79th Division will revolt.

00:04:23.125 --> 00:04:24.166
We'll join the Communist side.

00:04:24.916 --> 00:04:25.541
We'll abandon darkness for light.

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:35.833
Commander.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.250
If we defect to the Communists,

00:04:39.291 --> 00:04:40.041
will they even accept us?

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.000
We're soldiers of the Kuomintang.

00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:44.333
How can we join the Communist side?

00:04:47.708 --> 00:04:49.625
I know what everyone's concerns are.

00:04:53.083 --> 00:04:55.333
But the Party and the Nation have lost their power, brothers.

00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:58.625
I can't drag you all into the fire.

00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:01.541
If we don't join the Communists,

00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:03.625
we'll all have to go to Taiwan, China.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.916
I know the Party and the Nation's military strength.

00:05:09.583 --> 00:05:13.041
The Chief and General Sun Li-jen don't get along.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.833
What about the others?

00:05:17.791 --> 00:05:19.291
Useless officials.

00:05:23.583 --> 00:05:24.625
If we

00:05:25.208 --> 00:05:26.625
really go to Taiwan, China,

00:05:28.625 --> 00:05:30.250
I'm afraid in our lifetime

00:05:30.416 --> 00:05:34.000
we'll never return.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.083
It's not that I'm ungrateful.

00:05:47.083 --> 00:05:48.708
It's the Party and the Nationâ€”

00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:52.291
it's truly finished.

00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:58.583
I won't force anyone.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.166
Those willing to follow me,

00:06:03.208 --> 00:06:03.791
take up your weapons.

00:06:05.333 --> 00:06:05.833
Those unwilling,

00:06:07.083 --> 00:06:07.958
put down your weapons.

00:06:08.583 --> 00:06:09.708
or go home and farm,

00:06:11.083 --> 00:06:12.250
or join another unit.

00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:15.333
If anyone thinks I

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.541
don't deserve to live,

00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:19.333
you may kill me right here.

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.458
I won't object.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.166
If now

00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:32.541
someone really shoots me here,

00:06:34.583 --> 00:06:35.041
listen up,

00:06:36.958 --> 00:06:37.500
don't stop them.

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:40.791
Let him go.

00:06:53.791 --> 00:06:54.083
Wait.

00:06:54.625 --> 00:06:55.666
Go to the supply office

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:57.083
and draw some travel expenses.

00:06:58.208 --> 00:06:59.291
They won't make things difficult for you.

00:07:17.625 --> 00:07:18.791
From now on,

00:07:20.833 --> 00:07:22.500
we are true brothers.

00:07:32.458 --> 00:07:33.333
Go back and get ready now.

00:07:34.166 --> 00:07:35.125
We revolt and cross the river tonight.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.333
Yes.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.208
The brothers from our three regiments

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:40.416
will abandon darkness for light.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:41.958
We cross the river tonight.

00:07:42.333 --> 00:07:43.583
What about the other three regiments?

00:07:44.458 --> 00:07:45.125
Will they cause trouble?

00:07:48.125 --> 00:07:50.125
Trouble is inevitable.

00:07:51.708 --> 00:07:52.541
To be safe,

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.333
we act now.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.416
Since you joined us,

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.125
it's like adding wings to a tiger.

00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:05.041
But for now,

00:08:06.125 --> 00:08:07.208
on Director Deng's side,

00:08:08.083 --> 00:08:09.500
he might not let us go.

00:08:14.083 --> 00:08:15.041
That scum

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.916
preys on the people.

00:08:18.041 --> 00:08:20.625
Let's deal with him before we cross the river.

00:08:21.625 --> 00:08:23.166
This will be his burial ground.

00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:41.583
Commander Wang,

00:08:42.666 --> 00:08:43.791
is it the leader that's crooked

00:08:44.333 --> 00:08:45.708
or the ranks below?

00:08:50.125 --> 00:08:51.083
If the leader isn't crooked,

00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:53.625
the ranks won't be crooked either.

00:08:55.166 --> 00:08:56.666
You're the one who's crooked.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.250
You want to rebel.
