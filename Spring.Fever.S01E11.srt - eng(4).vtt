00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:13.836
(Duting Station)

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.560
Is Lord Shen here?

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.000
He's not here.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.280
Do you need something?

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.800
(Oh, no. Could he be in danger?)

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.080
Where is he now?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.520
Well...

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.000
Speak up!

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.600
Master Lu

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.840
invited him for drinks at Duchun House.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.920
Duchun House?

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.760
My lord.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.992
Here's the indenture.

00:00:54.656 --> 00:00:55.560
(Indenture)

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.560
Thank you, my lord.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.680
Wait.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.680
This...

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.560
My lord, Master Lu's paid enough.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.600
These pearls are worth
at least 500 taels of silver.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.600
Who said I'm only buying one?

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.360
Release all those coerced into service.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.200
(Duchun House for drinks and women?
And you're from the Inner Bureau?)

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.464
(You don't even know
assassins are coming.)

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.320
Lu Shi'an,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.360
if you get drunk,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.000
I won't take you home.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.360
My lord.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.120
Today, I'll address you as Que.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.520
Que, you're truly magnanimous.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.960
You bought so many girls,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.200
yet taking none with you.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.840
I didn't buy them.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.640
I redeemed their freedom.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.200
You don't like any of them?

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.600
That girl earlier

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.080
was so pure.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.600
I thought you'd take her with you.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.840
I don't like her.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.760
Then name your preference.
I'll arrange it all.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.600
If I name someone in the future,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.560
you mustn't go back on your word.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.600
As long as it's within my means,

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.656
consider it done.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.880
But given your position,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.480
even if you want to act recklessly,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.560
you should still maintain discretion.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.160
For those who don't belong to you,

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.880
don't touch them.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.040
For example?

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.160
Que, you may not believe me.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.800
But here in Ningzhou,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.920
there's a local legend.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.160
What's the story?

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.200
Years ago,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.960
there was a Master Murong here,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.320
who seized the wife
of the Wu family's eldest son.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.880
In the end, both of them

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.400
were beheaded by the Wu's second son.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.840
A tragic ending.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.600
But how come I heard

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.920
this tale originated
from Gu County up north,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.240
but not in Ningzhou?

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.800
Besides,

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.600
that Wu woman was originally
a concubine from a wealthy family.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.480
She was driven out by the matriarch

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.600
and forced to marry the eldest son
of the Wu family.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.960
A pitiful soul indeed.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.960
You pity the Wu woman so much.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.040
So you fancy married women.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.840
I only pity her poor choice in men.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.200
Master Lu, bad news.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.320
Concubine Ye is in trouble.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.600
The kidnappers demand
5,000 taels of silver.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.360
If not paid,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.944
they'll kill her in three days.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.000
Get the money to save her. Hurry!

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.160
Don't you know
how much money do we have?

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.440
This amount would bankrupt
the Lu family.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.680
So what?

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.160
She's A'man.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.720
I'll pay any price to save her.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.200
Even my life is worth giving!

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.480
Stop right there!

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.280
Shi'an, what's wrong with you today?

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.160
You've never acted this way before.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.760
Grandmother,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.760
you forbid me from making cosmetics

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.920
and jewelry crafting.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.000
Fine.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.520
When my father was alive,
he beat me, berated me,

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:33.680
forced me to study,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.160
and made me learn business. Fine.

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.000
My mother denied A'man proper status

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.240
and made me marry Jinzhi. Fine.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.800
I've obeyed you all.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.680
But now,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.320
I just want to save my true love.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.960
Today, no one will stop me!

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.440
Que,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.640
will you block me from saving A'man?

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.840
Thank you, my lord.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.760
You're welcome.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.920
Master Lu is too drunk
to get anything done.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.560
Besides, 5,000 taels of silver
isn't much.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.200
I have the money. I'll cover it for you.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.840
My lord, you really care
about Concubine Ye.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.760
Human lives are at stake.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.040
This matter also involves banditry.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.000
As an imperial envoy,

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.080
and having received
your hospitality these past days,

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.120
I cannot remain uninvolved
both officially and personally.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.040
Scar, bring the wine.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.080
Boss.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.640
Boss.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.720
Here is the wine.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.400
Scar.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.680
Clean it up after eating and drinking.

00:07:02.816 --> 00:07:03.840
Leave no traces behind.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.240
Okay.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.960
You are quite a fresh beauty.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:08.600
Stay put!

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.680
Behave yourself!

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.120
Boss.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.360
That woman is extremely pretty.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.600
Have you taken a fancy too?

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.240
Too bad! We can just look
but can't touch her.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.360
Not satisfying enough.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.560
Come on. Let's drink.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.920
Boss,

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.696
Lu Shi'an is here with the money.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:30.960
Excellent.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.520
Let's go greet Master Lu.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.120
Let's go.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.720
It's really Lu Shi'an?

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.440
Lu Shi'an.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.720
A'man?

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.600
Don't be afraid. I'm here now.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.600
I've delivered
the 5,000 taels of silver.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.240
May I take her now?

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.840
Now that you are here,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.440
how could you leave so soon?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.800
Capturing you would be worth
far more than 5,000 taels of silver.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.680
How can you go back on your word?

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.400
Why don't you speak?

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.280
What are you doing here?

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.200
You don't want me here?

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.960
Are you worried about my safety,
or wishing someone else had come?

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.000
Weren't you out drinking with Lu Shi'an?

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.400
You knew about that?

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.080
Well, well. You've been tracking
the Inner Bureau's movements.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.000
Quite bold of you.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.960
I wasn't tracking you.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.160
I merely noticed someone

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.800
with purlicue tattoos on the road

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.960
and thought they might come to kill you.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:13.360
So I tried to warn you.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.600
But you were off drinking,

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.840
while I got captured.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.200
What's so funny?

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.040
I suddenly remembered

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:25.400
a story Lu Shi'an told me
at Duchun House.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.600
What kind of story?

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:28.720
Nothing important.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.920
Just a story about me meeting a bad end.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.760
What about Lu Shi'an?

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.440
He was supposed to come,

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.680
but he got too drunk to stand.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.440
So I knocked him out.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:45.160
You shouldn't have
delivered the money at all.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.200
What else could I do?

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.160
I guess I deserve this.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.640
My lord.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.200
You're risking your life for her?

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.840
Who said it's for her?

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.240
The handwriting on that letter

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.696
matches perfectly
with what I received in the capital.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:06.560
What does it mean?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.800
Chai Er, who we're looking for,
is hiding with these pirates.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.440
You know nothing.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.760
Wouldn't it be more dangerous
if you go alone?

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.240
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.960
Don't you know the basic principle?

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.880
With all due respect,
I find that hard to believe, my lord.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:25.720
Does Lady Ye truly
have no involvement here?

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.640
Shut your mouth!

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.080
Fine.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.248
Have it your way.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:31.880
A'man.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.560
A'man.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.280
You know nothing.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.240
I was just teasing you.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.640
Actually, I came to find someone.

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.080
Find someone?

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.360
Yes.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.800
The person who wrote to you

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.640
is among them?

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:56.600
Yes.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.480
They all have tattoos on their purlicue.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.240
They might be accomplices.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.080
But why do they kidnap me?

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.040
Because you're the bait.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.240
Maybe to certain people,

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.280
you're priceless.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.840
If someone is helping them,

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.600
then you shouldn't
reveal your identity even more.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.200
You're worth more than Lu Shi'an.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.640
Exactly. So for now, I am Lu Shi'an.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.160
Then I'll call you Shi'an.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.600
If you call me Shi'an,

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.240
I-I'm afraid I won't react in time.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.120
How about you call me "My love"?

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.400
I... That would feel more natural to me.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:44.600
My love?

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.200
Don't dodge.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.360
They're watching.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:58.000
If you dodge, they'll see it through.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.160
This is the tea garden
of Taodu Village in the southwest.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.440
Taodu Village in the southwest?

00:12:29.152 --> 00:12:30.816
Boss, we've brought them back.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.480
Get down.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.400
Boss, Immortal...

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:52.800
What?

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:53.360
Nothing.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:53.960
Let's go.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:54.520
Hurry.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:02.760
Is anything wrong?

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.000
That's not the Master Lu.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.784
He's the Governor-General
from the capital.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.200
That's him!

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.760
He beheaded so many of my men.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:15.960
Come here.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.680
Thank you, sir.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.240
Sir,

00:13:27.008 --> 00:13:28.640
how many people are there
in your family?

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:29.840
Shut up!

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.120
Have you married and had children?

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.920
Your line of work seems quite dangerous.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:36.200
How about joining the Lu family
for some small business?

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.000
This doesn't concern you.
Behave yourself!

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.240
I'm the heir of the Lu family.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.720
How could you look down on me?

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.880
You're absolutely useless!

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.160
You even know about that?

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.000
Are you very familiar with my family?

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.840
Your fool! Are you trying
to get me to talk?

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.800
Scar, bring it here.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.720
What are you doing?

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:01.880
Drink it!

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.000
What did you make him drink?

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.560
Drink!

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.800
Behave yourself!

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.080
Are you alright?

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.880
Don't fall asleep.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.400
Wake up. Wake up!

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.560
I'll go beg them.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:21.440
Wait.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.560
There's an antidote in my collar.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.280
It's a special antidote I made.
Keep it with you.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.200
Just in case.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
It could save my life.

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.120
Antidote?

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.040
Yes.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.680
Where is it?

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.200
O-On the left.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.040
Left?

00:15:19.264 --> 00:15:22.304
