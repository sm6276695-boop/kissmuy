[Between Love and Frost]

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.020
[Episode 7]

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.430
What?

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.200
Waiting for Gu Tongce

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.400
to explain to him?

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.230
You only care about him,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.760
not my father's safety,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.840
or how I feel, huh?

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.920
Put me down.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.120
Tell me earlier if you want to use me.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.590
How deeply do you feel for Gu Tongce?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.920
Even at the cost of your fame,

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.760
you ruined my succession ceremony!

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.150
So all your kindness

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.710
and tenderness to me

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.920
were a lie, right?

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.640
No.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.640
But I have things I must do.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.040
To capture Chu Huaixuan,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.150
you even ruined me.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.920
From today on,

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.400
you're not leaving this mansion.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.920
From now on,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.950
I'll always keep an eye on you.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.150
Try forcing your way out?

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.790
Bring it on.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.310
Though we both

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.400
end up battered,

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.840
you still won't escape.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.120
Even if you can,

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.710
you'll be too weak to kill Chu Huaixuan.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.190
About what happened today,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.000
I'm very sorry.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.590
If you want to punish me,

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.750
torture me and take your revenge,

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.560
just do what you want.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.870
But nothing will stop me.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.960
Then go ahead and try.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.360
He's raging right now.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.630
Best not to clash head-on.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.560
I'll wait and meet Gu Tongce.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.000
We had an agreement.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.910
Where is he?

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.310
You even bring it up?

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.630
You've ruined everything!

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.360
The succession ceremony was interrupted.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:22.710
How did you do it?

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.430
As my woman,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.240
you kissed Gu Tongpei in public.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.560
Do I mean anything to you?

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.080
So

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.150
you refuse to keep your promise?

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.800
As you broke yours first,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.750
you have no grounds to demand anything.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.240
In this case,

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.710
I'll turn to Gu Tongpei for cooperation.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.840
Unlike you, he won't be so erratic,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.840
tearing up deals on a whim.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.150
I can handle Gu Tongpei,

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.150
so I can also handle you.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.240
If we join forces,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.400
think hard about it...

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.240
He won't trust you.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.150
He hasn't killed me yet.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.910
Don't you think he trusts me?

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.190
You and I

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.190
are not a couple,

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.310
but partners.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.720
I don't know why you're pissed off

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.800
and why you are mad.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.600
But tonight I must

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.040
see Chu Huaixuan,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.270
or

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.950
I won't let you go.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.310
Now

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.310
I must not offend her.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.160
Without my permission,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.160
how dare you wander off?

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.560
Mr. Liu,

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.510
what do you want to do?

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.800
She ruined the succession ceremony.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.920
She must harbor ulterior motives.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.560
I need arrest her

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.000
for rigorous interrogation!

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:53.680
Take her away!

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.310
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.160
Without my explicit orders,

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.360
who dares lay a finger on her?

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.720
Do you act like a Military Governor?

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.560
Going to such lengths to defend her.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.830
What will your father think

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:15.830
if he finds out?

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.430
This is my family affair.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.310
Stay out of it!

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.950
Today, no one lays a hand on her.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.560
Go.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.920
I...

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.190
No more words.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.070
Minghui.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.510
Your matter is all done.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.750
You may collect him now.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.310
We're paid to kill you.

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.430
I'm sorry, Mr. Chu.

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.660
[Palace of Joy]

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.560
So it's you who want to kill me?

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:58.950
Why?

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.750
It has been just a decade,

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:06.600
yet you've forgotten me.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.240
You are...

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.720
What happened?

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.430
He struck a deal with me,

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.320
and paid far more than you did

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.550
for your life.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.200
I'll trade businesses on four streets

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:37.790
for my own life.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:38.960
Let me go

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.150
and kill the one who bought my death.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:47.750
Who'd turn down easy money?

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:49.320
Fair enough.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.240
Precisely.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.630
No one would turn down easy money.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.510
I'd drag someone down with me.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.320
But if he is dead,

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:03.390
who'll pay you then?

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:04.320
Don't listen to her wild talk!

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:04.790
Take her out!

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.750
I'll pay you just the same.

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:27.960
Someone reported

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.030
gunfire and brawling here!

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.630
Take them back to the bureau
for interrogation.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.150
I'm just doing business

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:45.630
with Mr. Chu.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.360
Long,

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.030
we've known each other long enough.

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:54.750
Today, you broke the rules.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.600
If I simply let you walk away,

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.000
tomorrow Jiang City will drown in chaos.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.630
You'll come with me.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.750
What if I refuse?

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.120
Put down your weapon
if you wish to live.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:03.200
You people

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.630
have no regard for rules these days.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.120
Tongce,

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.960
even as the police director,

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:11.390
you can't contain them.

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:14.390
Are you alright?

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.750
Tongpei,

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.910
leave maintaining the law

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.440
and order to me.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.120
Mr. Chu,

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.510
please come with us.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:34.750
I need to see the Military Governor.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.670
Come with us for a full investigation

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.150
and then

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.150
you'll see him.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:42.600
Take them all!

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.150
Go! Hurry up!

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:49.670
Move!

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:52.750
What's happening?

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:55.510
I've kept tabs on him

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.750
and noticed something off.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.750
I raced over here out of worrying you.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.240
You can rest easy.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.200
Tonight, Chu Huaixuan isn't escaping.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:05.630
Let's go.

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.750
Sorry, no time to explain.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:34.550
Release me!

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:36.550
Why do you lock me up?

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.750
Let me out!

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:40.630
I demand to see the Military Governor.

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.240
[A mother reaps her own woes.]
I demand to see the Military Governor.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.790
Someone!

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.790
Why do you lock me up?

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.670
Guards!

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.240
Let me out!

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.480
You wretched creature!

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.320
How I wish I had killed you back then!

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.960
I shouldn't have let you survive!

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.240
Back then, as my father died young,

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.960
you deceived my mother with sweet talk

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.320
and married into our family

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.960
only

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.120
to betray us.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.240
You even slaughtered my family
for wealth.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.910
Luckily, I survived precisely for this day

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.750
to hunt down a fiend like you!

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:19.000
You want to kill me?

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:22.320
If so, you would have struck long ago.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.720
With my power now,

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.320
dare you even attempt it?

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.960
I spare your life

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:35.630
only to ask you questions.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:44.100
About those who murdered my family,

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.340
besides you, Mr. Liu

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.220
and Mr. Sun,

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.780
who was the fourth?

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.140
You want to know?

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.660
In your dreams!

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:12.860
I'll kill you.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:14.220
Fine by me.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.020
See if you can survive till then.

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.580
I'll talk!

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.060
Tell me who it was!

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:26.980
It's...

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.340
What is he?

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.060
You even protect him like this!

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:36.700
Alright.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.580
I'm asking you one last time!

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.780
The Military Governor Gu Rongchong.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:16.820
I propose

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.260
we toast

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.540
to my son, Gu Tongpei.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:21.780
We can

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.780
get along peacefully.
