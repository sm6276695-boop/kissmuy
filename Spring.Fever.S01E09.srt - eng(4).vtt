=Episode 9=

00:00:09.088 --> 00:00:10.624
(Lu Residence)

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.520
What's going on here?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.680
The immortal said

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.840
mugwort needs to be burned here
to dispel bad luck.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.360
You actually believe what she said?

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.680
Given my mother's condition,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.760
how could I not believe it?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.960
Just a while.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.000
Lord Shen?

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.000
Why are you here?

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.440
I came to burn mugwort too,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.880
to dispel bad luck.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.840
A'man,

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.440
drink some ginger soup to warm up.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.800
Let me feed you.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.480
No need, my lord. I'll do it.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.080
Come on.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.440
A'man,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.320
let me feed you.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.560
Come on, A'man.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.760
My lord.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.920
I should handle this.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.280
I'll do it.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.120
Why keep fanning like this?

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.240
Why not just open the door?

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.200
See? Fanning like this is more...

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.280
Ghost!

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.280
Stop screaming.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.240
My lord.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.800
I meant to eavesdrop,

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.800
but he unexpectedly opened the door.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.280
Good work.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.760
How's the investigation
into the recent ghost sightings?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.280
The Lu family has so many secrets.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.280
After Master Lu returned
from Duting Station years ago,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.520
he changed a lot,

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.640
having constant nightmares

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.120
and forbidding mention
of Duting Station.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.480
It was also he who ordered Prefect Xia
to seal Duting Station.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.760
Then he died?

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.680
Exactly.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.000
Right.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.840
I heard Madam Lu say
she didn't administer any poison.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.400
It sounded genuine.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.160
It's plausible.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.640
Yes.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.080
We've switched medications before.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.040
Our substitutions were righteous.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.080
Then I'll spread more rumors outside.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.560
Lady Ye, pardon the intrusion.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.760
What's wrong?

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.480
Hand it over.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.880
Wait.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.480
Give it to me.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.880
Wait, hey!

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.880
You...

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.760
- Trying to run?
- Don't...

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.760
Close the door.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.520
You do it yourself.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.960
This is Gao Fu's secret remedy,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.640
best for treating sprains and bruises.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.880
Apply it today,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.440
and your knee will improve tomorrow.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.680
Thank you.

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.760
When the ghost stories
about the Lus and Duting Station spread,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.640
clues even officials couldn't obtain

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.880
are got effortlessly
by supernatural forces.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.720
I thought this would implicate you,

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.640
but instead, it's benefited you.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.120
Benefited me how?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.600
When was the red phosphorus taken out?

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.840
That was a divine sign.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.560
Well, fine.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.760
Whatever you say.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.000
Tomorrow will be eventful.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.720
What are you doing?

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.560
The interrogation's finished,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.000
and I'm scared of ghosts too.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.840
I'll sleep here tonight.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.640
Move aside.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.480
Fine, I'll sleep over there then.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.840
I need to act alongside you tomorrow,

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.080
which is exhausting.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.280
Lady Ye, you are so considerate.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.560
Extremely comfortable.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.440
Close the spectral gate,
Lu family scion.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.360
Noble protection, calamity dispelled.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.440
Concubine Ye truly manifested
a divine sign.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.680
Seems she was framed.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.920
But what does this message mean?

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:51.960
Dowager Lu said

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.280
you have been in Ningzhou for days,

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.720
but unfortunately, she's unwell

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.080
and cannot attend today.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.000
We hope for your understanding.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.320
I understand.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.280
Let's begin then.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.880
(They believe such shoddy tricks?)

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.600
Wait,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.640
that wasn't a divine sign.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.880
Someone orchestrated it.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:44.280
That day, you made me kneel
in the streets like Widow Zhang.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.240
If my sincerity moved Heaven,

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.760
the rain would fall, right?

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.400
Exactly.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.160
I didn't believe it at first.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.720
Yet you insisted Immortal Song

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.720
held boundless power in Ningzhou,

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.800
with unfailing accuracy.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.680
Wait? You're denying your own words now?

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.680
It's not that I deny them.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.640
B-But there's something strange here.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.920
Immortal Song, you make claims

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.960
which others have to accept.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.160
Yet when others speak of you,

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.240
you refuse to acknowledge.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.040
I knelt on the main street,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.000
and the rains did fall.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.480
Everything was done as you said.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.680
What's strange about that?

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.920
Exactly.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.160
She doesn't commune with gods.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.160
How could she command the elements?

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.880
Is this the divine sign you mentioned.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.080
What? Will you now claim

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.480
you were spouting nonsense that day?

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.880
I've heard a saying.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.120
True divine signs will vanish
once fulfilled.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.360
Isn't that so?

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:53.920
Yes.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.600
The divine sign states:

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.800
Close the spectral gate,
Lu family scion.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.360
Noble protection, calamity dispelled.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.600
It means to seal
your so-called spectral gate,

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.560
we must select a Lu family descendant

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.480
to be fostered by a noble person

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.960
and thus avert disaster.

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.240
The most distinguished person present

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.080
is Lord Shen.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.960
As the court-appointed Governor-General

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.720
sent from the capital,

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.760
he carries the North Star's protection.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.160
Don't you agree?

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:32.960
Yes.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.800
Then let Lord Shen
choose a Lu descendant

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.240
to establish a foster bond.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.440
A foster bond?

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.600
Shouldn't Dowager Lu
be present for this?

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.280
Please, my lord.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.600
After you, Madam.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.240
Chenghuan, why wasn't I informed
of Lord Shen's arrival?

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.320
Even I'm in poor health,

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.880
proper courtesy must be observed.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:13.920
It's fine.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.920
But Lady Ye insists

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.160
I must establish a foster bond
with the Lu family.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.440
So I think

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.360
since this concerns a foster bond,

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.120
your presence seemed appropriate.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.840
Concubine Ye,

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.200
is this foster bond truly necessary?

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.920
Madam,

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.760
only with a foster bond

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.200
will the divine sign vanish.

00:08:49.152 --> 00:08:52.640
If the foster bond is unavoidable,

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.240
among all the Lu family descendants,

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.400
Shi'an shall be my foster son.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:05.960
No.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:07.800
Why?

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.720
Shi'an is nearly your age.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.000
Making him as your foster son would make

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.320
the Lu family a laughingstock.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:21.040
Then you mean...

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.480
Well...

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.920
Only Jin remains suitable.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.920
Jin's age fits perfectly.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.440
Then let Jin perform the tea ceremony.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.520
What do you think, Madam?

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.360
Okay.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.160
Chenghuan,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.840
fetch Jin here.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.040
(You've got some nerve.)

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.080
(I taught you to strike emotionally,
yet you scheme against me?)

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.360
Madam.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.320
Jin.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.520
Go. Present tea to your foster father.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.360
Go.

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:09.920
Father, your tea.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.600
A concubine-born daughter

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.880
isn't worthy to bear Lord Shen's name.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.760
This adoption's merely
a ritual necessity.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:31.040
Lord Shen shouldn't take it seriously.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.400
Jin, from now on,

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.520
within the Lu residence,

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.680
none but Lady Ye

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.280
may lay a finger on you.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.400
Understand?

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.280
Go. Find your mother now.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.520
Madam.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:02.400
My lord,

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.280
Jin is under your blessed fortune.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.120
Who would dare bully her?

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.640
If no one's bullying her,

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.520
that would be for the best.

00:11:17.184 --> 00:11:19.264
(Adoption Letter)

00:11:20.928 --> 00:11:24.440
(Father: Lu Shi'an; Foster Father:
Shen Que; Foster Child: Jin)

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.920
This is truly peculiar.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.320
Once the foster bond was established,

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.840
the divine sign actually vanished.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.400
I never expected

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.720
that Concubine Ye has the skill
to turn situations to her advantage.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.440
This show was well played.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.520
It began as expected,

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:46.640
but ended beyond expectations.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.000
Ghostly disturbances first,

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.080
then kneeling in the streets.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.960
Now this adoption scheme emerges.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.920
They made the Lu family restless.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:58.760
Why don't you intervene?

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.200
I can't stop it.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.960
Public opinion is a raging beast.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.200
Let the floodwaters rise.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.240
Then we'll remain secure,

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.040
watching them battle with each other.

00:12:18.848 --> 00:12:21.248
(Prefect's Mansion)

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.320
My lord, I failed in my duty.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:24.680
leaving a loophole.

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.880
I shall be punished.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.480
Never mind.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.200
I never expected

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.520
you local bosses to suppress him.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.480
It's okay.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.040
Let him win this first round.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.680
So his guard will lower.

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.440
My lord, you have other lethal moves?

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.160
You talk too much. Just leave.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.240
Understood.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.040
Lady Ye, wait.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:01.760
The formal adoption banquet
for Lady Jin will be held in two days.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.080
Dowager Lu ordered Yunxiang Clothier

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.120
to select two batches of premium Lu silk

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.520
for her garments.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.400
You know her measurements
and preferences best.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.960
Assist the craftsmen with selections.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.280
Dowager Lu is really thoughtful.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.648
(Lu Residence)

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:33.600
Come here.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.520
Master Lu, as you requested.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.240
Poria cocos and angelica root
are premium additives for pearl cream.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.760
And fruits from Baihe House.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.520
As usual, additives aren't charged
to the Lu family.

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.040
Fruits and errand fees paid in cash.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:46.640
Okay.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.000
Go.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.200
Jin?

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.640
Why are you standing here?

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.680
It's dark. Madam hasn't returned.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.400
She went to the clothier

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:00.440
and will return later.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.640
Don't tell your great-grandmother

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.120
I buy ingredients for pearl powder.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:10.760
Understood?

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.280
Yes.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:17.800
Take this.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.960
Don't let others see. Be good.
