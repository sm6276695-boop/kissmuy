=Lust and Lies=

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.359
Here.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.399
Here.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.540
=Episode 19=

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.400
Put me down!

00:01:59.079 --> 00:01:59.680
Let go of me!

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:05.040
Why?

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.480
Are you trying to hold me captive?

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.680
If you dare try anything funny again,

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.439
I don't mind holding you captive here.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.080
It should be the other way around, no?

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:20.759
That way,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.759
at least you won't betray me.

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:31.120
Is your engagement with Sheng Weilian

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:33.000
considered a betrayal?

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.199
The Lion Seal?

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:50.800
Didn't you warn me?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.280
A true revenge

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.080
is not without a plan.

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.080
And we shouldn't act recklessly.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.199
This shall be your bargaining chip.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.159
And this is my reward for you.

Where is Huo Xiu?

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:01.759
He's not back yet.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.319
If he doesn't return with her body,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.360
you'll go

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:07.719
and get rid of them both.

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:09.080
But

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.759
Governor,

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.919
the Huo family and the Sheng family

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:13.840
have had a marriage alliance, no?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.879
Mr. Sheng.

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:17.120
You won't mind

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.680
having a dead bride, do you?

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.680
Not at all.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.879
Everyone in Sucheng

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:28.399
is aware of our marriage alliance.

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.240
Our families

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.879
are

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.920
on the same boat.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.279
It doesn't matter

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.360
if the bride is dead or alive.

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:43.360
You're right, Governor.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.560
I'm feeling kind of unwell.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.360
I need to head back now.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.480
Hold on.

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:55.040
You should pay respect to my son first.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.839
Do you still remember it?

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:02.959
Back then,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.720
you blindfolded me and told me

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.240
it's just a killing act.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.199
You're here to kill me, no?

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.040
I won't do that.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.680
But if one of us

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.079
must die today,

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.279
you should do it.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.399
You're not Huo Qingwan.

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:03.399
Am I right?

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.639
I'm the Huofeng Gang's mistress.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:09.480
My surname is Ruan.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.480
My name is Ruan Feifei.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.759
I can now

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:22.279
tell you who I am.

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:42.800
This is the Lion Seal?

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:45.920
It's just an ordinary pebble.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.959
And this is the Lion Seal.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.240
The former governor of Sucheng

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:20.560
died fifteen years ago.

00:08:21.399 --> 00:08:22.199
I've heard of him.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.160
He collaborated with the Japanese

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:25.839
and sold our country out.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.839
Here's the treaty signed
with the Japanese under the table.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.440
It's all about interests

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.080
and treasonous terms.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.000
Huo Beishan?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.919
Huo Beishan

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.840
was a mere dock worker.

00:08:49.713 --> 00:08:50.792
He gained Gu Changqing's favour

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.080
and joined the the Gu Army.

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:55.519
Who would've thought
he'd laid the entire Gu to family waste?

00:08:57.639 --> 00:08:59.039
He even forcibly married Madam Gu.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.120
Madam.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:06.679
Don't be afraid.

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:07.679
I won't hurt you.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.039
You animal!

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.320
You planted all those crimes
on the Gu family!

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.200
You even plotted to kill Changqing...

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.080
If I hadn't destroyed the Gu family,

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:21.320
how could I have
become Sucheng's governor?

00:09:27.159 --> 00:09:28.200
Let me go!

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.080
Let go!

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:39.159
Can you bring yourself

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.559
to kill Gu Changqing's child?

00:09:45.813 --> 00:09:47.000
You should stay alive

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:48.720
and be my wife.

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:51.360
Then you can get back at me.

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:01.879
So

00:10:02.759 --> 00:10:04.159
Madam Gu was your mother?

00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:06.159
You were Gu Changqing's son?

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.639
Now you know why

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.799
Huo Beishan got upset

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.120
over your earrings.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.120
Because that has to do
with the Gu family's blood feud.

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.919
Huo Beishan

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.240
became reputable
by eradicating traitors in Sucheng.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.559
Who would have thought

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.919
he's the ungrateful traitor here?
