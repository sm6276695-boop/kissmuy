00:00:06.016 --> 00:00:08.928
=Spring Fever=
=Episode 2=

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.160
I was healing at the temple.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.720
You shouted and drew my pursuers here,

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.800
making my poison flare up.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.000
So, you must take responsibility.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.280
If you had acted faster

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.880
against those two hooligans,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.080
I wouldn't have drawn them here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.360
Why blame me?

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.872
Besides,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:33.560
I have no money

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.840
or medical skills.
How can I take responsibility?

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.520
Suck my Gu poison out.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.776
You're shameless!

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.280
Shameless. Just kill me.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.240
Of course, I won't kill you.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.360
But I will certainly investigate

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.880
which family dares

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.120
harbor criminal slaves.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.768
Stop struggling.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.432
Just give in to me.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.440
Let go of me.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.200
According to the law,

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.160
harboring criminal slaves warrants

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.960
extermination of nine clans.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.040
Since we can't see each other now,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.320
I won't blame you for your offense.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.440
(I can't die yet.)

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.400
(Shi'an and Jin are waiting.
I must go home.)

Hey.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.760
Hey. Wake up.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.440
(Did he die?)

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.200
(Will the officials trace this to me?)

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.440
Hey.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.904
Hey.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.880
Wake up.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.840
(Thank god. He's alive.)

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.136
Hey.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.960
Are you okay?

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.000
Then I'll leave now.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.120
(Why is he delirious?)

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.680
(Did I fail to fully remove
the love poison?)

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.816
Get off!

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.856
My lord.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.920
Gao Fu.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.200
You've finally awakened.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.720
You were poisoned,

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.248
but luckily,

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.480
it was removed timely.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.840
You're fine now.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.520
When you arrived last night,

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.440
did I behave improperly?

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:53.720
(Gao Fu, Censor)
When I arrived,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.360
corpses were everywhere.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.320
When I found you,

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.600
this lady was calling out to you.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.280
Fearing she was an assassin,
I detained her

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.560
and awaited your command.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.960
So she and I...

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.560
Nothing happened between us.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.120
Last night, you begged me
to detoxify you.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.120
Then you suddenly went mad.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.960
During the struggle,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.520
you collapsed unconscious.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.960
I thought you died,

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.640
so I kept calling out to you.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.360
And then he arrived.

00:05:26.112 --> 00:05:27.040
Right.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.064
Good.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.800
But why did you ask it, my lord?

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.056
No reason.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.080
Have you identified those assassins?

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.760
We eliminated

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.560
all ambushers outside.

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.080
We kept one alive.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.480
But I didn't expect he would kill
himself, leaving no information.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.960
However, they all had a tattoo
on their hands.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.440
Here's the pattern.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.960
But no records match it in our archives.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:05.000
It seems Ningzhou Prefecture
is really extraordinary.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.920
Perhaps,

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.360
this tattoo could be our breakthrough.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.720
Figure it out right away.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.768
Yes.

00:06:13.888 --> 00:06:14.848
My lord.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.800
This lady...

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.480
- Silence her.
- Yes.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.640
Wait.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.000
You have last words?

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.520
I've seen this tattoo before.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.880
Where did you see it?

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.480
I was framed.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.680
Returning would be dangerous.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.880
Only you can help me.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.240
Resolve my problem at the Lu family
on Xiaowen Road tomorrow noon.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.312
And I'll tell you.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.400
You dare threaten me?

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.920
Consider your status first.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.880
My status doesn't matter.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.320
What matters is

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.360
that I know

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.920
what you want to know.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.240
(As you wished, I'm here.)

00:07:07.742 --> 00:07:09.120
(Imperial decree)

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.120
I'm Prefect of Ningzhou.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.160
Greetings, my lord.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.320
- Greetings, my lord.
- Greetings, my lord.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.680
Your visit here is...

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.080
Has the Young Lord
from the Duke Xuan's Mansion

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.400
already arrived in Ningzhou?

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.640
Gao Fu.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.440
Open it.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.376
Watch out.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.360
Lord Xia.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.320
The Young Lord was returning
to Bianzhou to visit family

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.800
and stopped to rest
in Ningzhou Prefecture.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.880
Before he'd even left the capital,

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.840
assassins were already lying in wait.

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.840
Had I not led the vanguard,

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.720
this blade would have been plunged
into his body.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.720
Tell me,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.800
who exactly is it

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.160
that wants the Young Lord dead
so desperately?

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.160
I will order
an investigation immediately.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.320
I'll find out swiftly

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.600
and give you a full account.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.640
Lord Xia.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.760
I've searched all over Ningzhou

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.120
looking for you.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.480
I'm exhausted now.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.720
Conduct the investigation here.

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.360
I'll be waiting.

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.600
Yes.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.800
You seem

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.160
somewhat familiar to me.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.320
Lord Shen,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.600
she is my concubine.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.800
She rarely ventures out.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.480
You must be mistaken.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.080
What crime

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.680
has she committed?

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:08.960
My lord,

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.200
this vile woman committed adultery
at the Goddess Temple last night,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.960
defiling the gods

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.640
and causing me to lose my child.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.960
She deserves death!

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.520
Lan,

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.000
I don't regret loving you sincerely.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.760
We were just bound by longing,

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:25.400
but not by fate.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.840
Then I wasn't mistaken.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.040
When I was attacked
in the temple yesterday,

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.200
you were also there.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.480
Yesterday, when assassins came for me

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.240
and chased me into the temple,

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.440
I saw her lighting lamps alone.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:54.400
She got caught in the battle
because of me.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.760
If I recall correctly,

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.600
all the assassins

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.560
should have been slain by me.

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.960
So I'd like to ask

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.040
how he got away unscathed?

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.408
Well...

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.720
My lord,

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.600
could it be

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.880
he's in league with the assassins?

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.240
Perfect.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.640
We've got one empty cage left.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.736
Exactly.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.200
Lord Xia.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.000
How about

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.360
I sever this escaped assassin's head

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.240
and deliver it to you?

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.480
How's that?

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.424
No.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.000
My lord!

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.040
- I'm innocent, my lord!
- Shut up!

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.880
Guards! Take him away.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.360
Lady Jinzhi, you promised me...

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:47.584
My lord.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.600
Xia Jinzhi believes

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.840
my failure to light her blessing lamp
in the temple

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.840
caused her child to die.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.440
But I think

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.280
her child's death

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.040
has no connection
to whether I lit lamps or not.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.080
My lord,

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.760
you know perfectly well

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.080
whether I committed adultery
last night, right?

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.400
Shut up!

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.720
You killed my son!

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.120
Whether you committed adultery

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.640
is certainly clear to me.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.480
However,

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.200
the notion that lamp-lighting

and the living one has check-up.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.240
We'll get to the bottom of it today.
