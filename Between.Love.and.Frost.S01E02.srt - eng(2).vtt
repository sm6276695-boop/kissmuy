You don't remember me, sir?

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.640
Ten years ago,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.440
it was you who celebrated my birthday.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.620
How was there a survivor?

Murder

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.580
demands a life in return.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.500
But I'm willing to give you

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.620
a chance.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.780
The keys to the chains

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.540
are sewn into each other's stomachs.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.300
Retrieve the keys,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.860
and maybe you'll live.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.100
I shall excuse myself.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.280
Don't go!

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.520
Sun,

The next deal

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.320
is to kill him.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.620
You'd kill your brother?

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.440
He's not my biological brother.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.080
I'm not connected to them.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.000
I'm only the Gu family's adopted son.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.160
He's got the evidence.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.520
I can't let him live.

In return, I want
Chu Huaixuan captured alive.

This guy wants to kill his brother.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.720
Why didn't he tell us yesterday?

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.800
If Gu Tongpei wakes up
and runs back to his mansion,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.200
it'll be hard for us to act.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.600
Stop jinxing it.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.160
Nobody.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.920
I really called it!

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.040
You jinxed it.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.560
He must've heard us

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.600
and escaped through the window.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.080
Hurry and block him.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.280
I'll ask our men
to go to the Governor's Mansion.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.240
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.060
You stole my thing,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.640
and now you're back.

What do you want?

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.320
I...

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:41.760
missed you.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.040
Give it back to me.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.260
What?

Don't take risks.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.760
I may consider

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.920
letting you live.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.440
Don't break my stuff.

Why do you want to kill me?

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:06.720
Sorry,

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.840
I don't like chatting with unknown men.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.520
Stay still.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.040
Drop the gun.

Demand anything you want.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.680
Demand?

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.520
Take off your clothes
and throw them to me.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.000
Maybe I'll let you live.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.800
Are you getting back at me?

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:06.760
Do it.

Never expected you were like this.

You want me to take my pants off too,
do you?

Hey.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.440

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.680
they are not attractive.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.540
Even their clothes were stripped off.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:41.060
Serves them right.
