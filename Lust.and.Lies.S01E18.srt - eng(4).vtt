His son is dead,

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.000
but Huo Beishan
has had a celebratory banquet.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.159
We should be

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.840
celebrating it instead.

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:44.520
Indeed.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:47.799
After Miss Ruan
and the Sheng family's marriage alliance,

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:49.600
the Huo family will have a hard time.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.320
Here.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.280
Cheers!

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:53.520
Boss Ruan, this is bad!

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:54.640
The backyard is on fire!

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.079
What?

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:58.520
Let's go!

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.320
Let's have a toast!

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.159
Cheers!

I'll make them

join you in the afterlife.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.920

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.920
for the photo shoot.

Qingwan.

Come and take some photo.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.680
What are we doing this for?

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:25.000
I need to make everyone in Sucheng
know my daughter,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.720
Huo Qingwan.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.839
The Huafeng Newspaper

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.920
wants to interview me.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.079
Last night,

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:42.360
Governor sent his men
to get rid of the Huofeng Gang

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:43.600
and safeguard Sucheng.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.639
It's said that bodies
were seen floating in the river.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.560
Those pirates have all been eradicated.

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:54.519
They've all been eradicated?

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:55.360
Yes.

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:57.480
It's the Huafeng Newspaper's honor

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.079
to be doing a report

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:00.480
on such a great achievement.

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:22.000
You knew it all,

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:23.920
but you chose to pretend to be ignorant.

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:26.480
That was Governor's order.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.319
Huo Xiu.

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:35.040
It's me who can't figure you out.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.319
Governor made me

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.160
choose between you and the Huofeng Gang.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.839
Of course I'd choose you.

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:47.160
I didn't ask you
to make the choice for me!

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.639
I told you so.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.160
This isn't the best time
for your vengeance.

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:02.639
Fine.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.560
You'll stay here

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.560
and be his lapdog.

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:23.639
Have you found the locksmith?

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:24.860
There have been some clues about him.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.959
I've been trying to lure him out,
but he hasn't taken the bait.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.680
Make it quick.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.079
Do you hear me?

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:40.120
You can open

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.759
the Lion Seal by yourself.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.639
That Japanese man
isn't a locksmith, is he?

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:13.959
Where is Huo Beishan?

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:15.639
Where is the Lion Seal?

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:18.000
Huo Beishan didn't ask you out.

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:19.240
I did.

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:21.680
That's alright.

00:08:22.079 --> 00:08:23.040
Give me the Lion Seal

00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:24.720
and I'll let you have this.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.079
Hey.

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:26.720
Why are you

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:28.319
coveting our valuable?

00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:31.959
No one despises money.

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:33.399
It's a shame that you're stupid.

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.519
Don't...

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:37.080
Don't kill me!

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:37.840
Don't kill me!

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:54.000
I've been looking for this
for more than ten years.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:01.628
(Yesterday, Governor Huo Beishan of Sucheng
led his men to wipe out the Huofeng Gang)

00:09:01.629 --> 00:09:02.980
(His long-lost beloved daughter is found)

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.360
Get me a gun.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.559
Don't try anything funny.

00:09:31.639 --> 00:09:33.240
Be it the Ruan family

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:34.759
or the Huofeng Gang,

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:35.919
I must get back at him!

00:09:36.639 --> 00:09:38.679
Otherwise, what's the point
of pretending to be Huo Qingwan?

00:09:39.799 --> 00:09:40.320
Qingwan...

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.440
Give me a gun.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.690
Aren't you afraid
she'd get herself killed

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.559
by provoking her this way?

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.799
No matter how many years

00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:31.879
you've had a dog,

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:34.639
you need to get rid of it and eat it

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.159
when it becomes useless.

00:10:40.759 --> 00:10:41.360
Miss Ruan.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.879
Starting today,

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:44.480
I shall be your teacher.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.519
I'll teach you
how to become Huo Qingwan.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.039
You should teach me how to kill.

00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:51.919
When you become Huo Qingwan,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.120
I will always be your gun.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.279
I'll help you with your vengeance.
