=Lust and Lies=

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:41.920
How is she, sir?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.359
Qingwan isn't allergic to
fish or shrimp.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.079
You meant for her to hear it, right?

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.040
For smart people,

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.959
you have to use foolish tricks.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.799
She's overconfident

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.200
and gives herself away.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.439
Uncle,

00:01:16.879 --> 00:01:17.799
the physician said

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:19.719
Qingwan isn't allergic.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.319
She was poisoned.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.060
=Episode 4=

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.879
You're awake.

00:01:59.239 --> 00:01:59.599
Come.

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:00.200
Slowly.

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:07.359
Governor,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.599
you didn't drink the soup, right?

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.599
I heard it was poisoned.

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:21.560
Luckily, none of you drank it.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.919
Qingwan,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.879
you've suffered.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.840
Being able to help Governor

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.199
is my honor.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.960
Looks like

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.439
there are quite a few rats
in the residence.

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:40.800
Take care of them.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.719
Yes, sir.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.280
Governor,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.639
this isn't our doing.

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:46.520
Miss Yiyi prepared the soup.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.759
Uncle.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.800
Uncle,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.319
I didn't poison it.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.439
Please trust me.

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.039
I really didn't.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.199
Yiyi,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.599
you...

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:58.520
I trust her.

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:00.479
If she poisoned it,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.319
it's too obvious.

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:05.080
Say,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.840
I think Zhong added something
to the soup.

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.360
He's the cook.

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:12.919
I thought it was seasoning.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.759
I didn't know it was poison.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:19.000
Qingwan.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.960
I'm sorry, Qingwan.

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:21.639
I was so careless.

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.120
I brought this harm on you.

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.520
Don't blame yourself.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.960
I should thank you for helping me.

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:29.639
Get up.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.840
Enough.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.280
Go

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:33.479
deal with that cook.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.599
Yes, sir.

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.080
The rest can go back.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.319
Let Qingwan rest.

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.479
You really stop at nothing.

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.039
I thought you gave yourself
allergy medicine.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.840
Yet you actually poisoned yourself.

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:14.520
You're wrong.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.680
I didn't poison myself,

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:18.800
and I don't even know Zhong.

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:21.759
How could it not be you?

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.319
You must be kidding.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.519
I'm just

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.439
a victim.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.360
Young Marshal, you can't kill me.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.920
It was your order.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.839
All the more reason for you to die.

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:43.439
No.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.120
Please.

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:03.519
Xiu.

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:08.240
You're back so late.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.839
The place is far,

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.319
so I'm back late.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.000
I heard Zhong

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:19.240
has been abusing others
under the name of the Huo family.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.120
He even killed someone.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.319
You're well-informed,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.120
Qingwan.

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.279
I found this poison

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:32.160
in his room.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.040
You put it there, didn't you?

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:36.319
How can you be sure

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.720
this poison is mine?

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.279
Because my nose is keen.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.120
Your body

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.680
carried a smell of cooking smoke.

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:58.759
I was puzzled

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.720
as to what the busy Young Marshal

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.519
was doing in the kitchen.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.199
Turns out it was to kill me.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.879
Looks like

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.279
we siblings

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.000
need a serious talk.

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:19.000
I agree.

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:21.800
But it's too late now.

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:23.000
I'm tired.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.959
Let's talk another day.

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:31.000
You're so sinful,

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:33.079
you'd best stay in the shadows.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.590
You've loved horses
since you were little.

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:49.600
I've got one for you.

00:06:53.081 --> 00:06:53.961
Thank you, Governor.

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:55.480
How is it?

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:56.439
Give it a try.

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.560
I fell off a horse

00:06:58.759 --> 00:06:59.920
when I was little.

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:01.120
I have scars on my back.

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:03.240
I don't dare.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.720
We're here to hunt.

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:06.480
How can you not ride?

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:08.319
Governor.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.439
Let me teach her.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.160
Sure.

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:20.639
Xiu,

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:22.360
I really can't.

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:23.000
Just try.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.480
Sometimes

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.160
it's harder

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:31.439
to pretend.

00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:36.680
Slowly.

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:38.959
Xiu,

00:07:39.079 --> 00:07:39.439
you...

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:40.120
Don't let go.

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:41.839
I'm scared.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.759
You're overreacting.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:48.759
Give it here.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.600
Xiu, I'll ride myself.

00:07:55.399 --> 00:07:55.959
Be careful.

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:57.759
Don't give me an opening.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:07:59.360
Thanks for the warning.

00:08:00.639 --> 00:08:00.959
Hyah.

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:09.519
Hyah.

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:12.519
Hyah.

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:29.319
What's going on?

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.839
Miss Huo's horse got shocked.

00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:32.159
Young Marshal killed the horse

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.200
to save her.

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:34.360
What?

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:44.660
I'm sorry for putting you
in a difficult spot,

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:45.919
Mother.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.200
You're afraid of riding.

00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:49.000
Why force yourself?

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.039
I wanted to make Governor happy.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.159
You're the daughter of the Huo family.

00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:57.159
No one can change that.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.440
I believe Beishan

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.879
will accept you sooner or later.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.120
Well,

00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:15.559
rest for now.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:42.879
I can see

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.320
you're a lunatic.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:47.200
How so?

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.600
You startled the horse

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:58.840
to hide your riding skills.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.519
Do you realize

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:01.919
that if it had trampled you,

00:10:02.679 --> 00:10:03.799
you'd be dead?

00:10:08.559 --> 00:10:10.320
You're worried about me.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:14.879
Xiu.

00:10:17.799 --> 00:10:18.399
Drop the act.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.720
Put away your little tricks.

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:25.840
I've been wondering why you dressed up
as the character Bai Suzhen

00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:28.480
in the Qingfang Troupe.

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:29.559
After all,

00:10:29.799 --> 00:10:32.200
the Huo Army isn't the type
to work in disguise.

00:10:33.039 --> 00:10:34.679
If it were for the Lion Seal,

00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:36.399
you could've seized it by force

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.200
and killed everyone.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:40.159
But you only took some out

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.919
and left some alive,

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.759
especially the man delivering the seal.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.600
There's only one possibility.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.960
You were

00:10:54.519 --> 00:10:55.960
together on this.

00:10:58.039 --> 00:10:59.240
The Lion Seal

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.960
was already in your hands
in the first place.

00:11:02.519 --> 00:11:04.000
You feared Governor would suspect

00:11:04.159 --> 00:11:05.639
if you handed it over directly,

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.159
so you staged this

00:11:09.159 --> 00:11:10.960
to hand off the Lion Seal

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.240
while keeping yourself clean.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.639
What?

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.080
I get it right?

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:26.720
Then, do you know

00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:29.360
Yan Qing was my person?

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:31.720
She betrayed me,

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.039
so I killed her.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.080
And now you're here using her name.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.320
You won't dare expose me.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.320
We've been tied together from the start,

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:44.360
haven't we, my brother?
