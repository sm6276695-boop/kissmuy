=Episode 6=

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.600
Dead twice in half a month.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.680
Take it one day at a time.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.480
Live differently.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.480
At least,

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.320
you won't compromise yourself,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.200
expecting a coward to protect you.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.640
In these woods,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.640
are ghosts watching us?

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.520
They are not ghosts.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.800
They're wolves.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.920
Wolves?

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.600
We just emerged from the graveyard.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.440
They smell the scent of death.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.760
The scent of death?

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.360
Exactly.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.960
They wait for your strength to fade.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.280
Then they'll strike immediately.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.920
Even if

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.400
we yielded

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.960
and humbled ourselves at every turn,
it is all in vain.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.120
It only reminds them

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.480
that you

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.320
are easy prey.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.200
Against them,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.720
this is what works.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.720
I can't.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.000
Keep your wrist steady.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.120
Your aim must be true.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.360
Killing wolves is like killing men.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.440
The one who shoots first

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.120
gets to live.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.480
Three.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.320
Two.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.280
One.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.440
My lord.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.080
My lord.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.800
Are you using me as bait
or hunting wolves?

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.520
Hunting wolves.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.080
Well, thanks a lot.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.080
Lady Ye.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.680
These are...

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.800
Proper clothes.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.840
Since you're returning,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.000
return with dignity.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.880
I will survive

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.600
for Jin to call me mother.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.240
I will survive

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.400
for those

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.680
who tried to kill me.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.560
I'll make them pay.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.720
Xia Jinzhi caused your death.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.240
Don't haunt us.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.960
I'll burn more joss paper.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.200
Move on to the afterlife.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.000
Please don't come after us.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.720
I'll burn more joss paper.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.120
Shi'an, come over here.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.720
What?

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.240
Wear this.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.480
No. I'm not wearing it.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.240
Be good.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.440
It's for protection.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.240
If Concubine Ye returns...

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.120
What?

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.760
Sh-She's back!

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:01.320
What?

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.200
She's back!

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.880
What?

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.920
Right there!

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.680
She's there!

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.320
No one's there.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.640
Truly no one, mother.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.160
No one?

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.800
She was here moments ago.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.600
Master Shi'an.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.360
Wh-What's the shouting?

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.640
You saw the ghost too?

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.080
No.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.720
Lord Shen's here to make arrests.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.640
A-Arrests?

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.240
My lord,

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.680
why arrest my maid?

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.320
Indeed, my lord.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.680
Look.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.240
If the maid made a mistake,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.400
just send her to the office.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.000
No need to trouble yourself

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.360
with judgment here.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.480
My lord, you mean...

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.800
The art of being an official

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.680
lies in the play

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.680
between reality and illusion.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.720
Sometimes, real actions are needed.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.800
Lord Xia, am I

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.080
right?

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.560
Yes! Absolutely right!

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.400
Danxiang,

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.200
by imperial law,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.880
the purchase of toxic medicines

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.600
requires prescriptions, limited amounts,
and real-name registration.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.480
If conducted without authorization,

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.200
both buyer and seller
shall receive 100 strokes.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.280
Yet you

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.280
used forged prescriptions
to purchase arsenic

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.440
in small quantities
at multiple pharmacies.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.200
Little by little, it adds up.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.640
Who were you planning to harm

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.440
with all this arsenic?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.360
Shi'an.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.520
Shi'an!

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.400
It wasn't my son.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.080
She told my son
that it was regular safflower.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:09.800
Whether that's true or not,

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.280
my son knew nothing of this.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.280
Look at you.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.440
M-My lord,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.400
I-I did buy arsenic,

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.520
but only to poison rats
in the courtyard.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.400
P-Please don't falsely accuse me.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.120
Poison rats in the courtyard?

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.600
Did you use it elsewhere?

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.880
I feared harming Lady Jinzhi,

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.320
so I never used it.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.240
Really?

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.360
Maybe you should think harder?

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.920
No, I didn't.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.040
Gao Fu.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.160
My lord.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.080
Bring your treasure in.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
My lord.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.680
My lord, this is...

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.520
Since she can't recall,

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.920
let the dog jog her memory.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.000
Go.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.360
Go away.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.120
Lord Xia.

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.600
A good dog. It doesn't bite.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.480
Smell.

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:34.960
Smell.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.120
My lord,

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.760
something's wrong here.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.200
Isn't this where Concubine Ye collapsed?

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.840
Collect evidence and investigate.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.560
Understood.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:29.960
My lord,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.440
there's poison.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.920
Madam Lu claimed

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.920
Concubine Ye collapsed in your chamber,

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.400
and we found

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.120
bloodstains and residue on the floor.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.560
The dogs also detected arsenic.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.080
What?

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.000
Do you still plan to brush this off

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.520
as coincidence?

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.760
My lord,

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.800
look.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.000
Ye Qinglan is already dead.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.800
No plaintiff, and no evidence remains.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.920
Maybe

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.320
we should drop the case?

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.200
Who says there's no plaintiff?

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.160
I am the plaintiff.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.040
Ghost!

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.560
Ghost!

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.880
Sh-She's back!

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:13.800
Shi'an.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.320
A'man?

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:14.800
Shi'an.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.720
Are you a human or ghost?

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.720
That depends on whether
some wish me a human

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.720
or ghost.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.360
Ghost! You must be a ghost!

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.880
Stay back! Don't come closer!

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.400
Madam?

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.160
Don't come any closer!

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.560
Go find Xia Jinzhi.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.240
It wasn't us.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.720
Lu...

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.040
Shi...

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.680
An.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.680
Mother.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.160
Mother.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.240
You took arsenic.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.160
You shouldn't be alive.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:10.400
Lady Jinzhi,

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.640
long time no see.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.080
I did it.

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.480
Who told you
to kill Lady Jinzhi's child?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.560
I wanted you dead.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.400
Danxiang,

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.280
you'd better think carefully

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.600
who truly ordered this?

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:36.160
Danxiang, your actions

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.880
make me appear dishonorable.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.800
Ye Qinglan,

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.080
Danxiang has already confessed.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.040
Stop falsely accusing others.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.160
I'll take her for proper interrogation

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.840
and give you a satisfactory resolution.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.240
Put the firearm down.

00:11:58.925 --> 00:12:01.965
♪Grind flesh between grit and stone♪

00:12:04.077 --> 00:12:08.397
♪Sink into pain,
only then are pearls born♪

00:12:11.789 --> 00:12:15.693
♪Wait until abyssal darkness
stains every inch of skin♪

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:22.893
♪Then comes the time to chase the dawn♪
