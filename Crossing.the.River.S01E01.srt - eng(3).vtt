00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:13.083
Stop!

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.416
I didn't get on the train.

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:42.750
I don't want to go to Taiwan, China.

00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:45.125
I want to stay with the workers.

00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:57.416
Either

00:02:58.291 --> 00:02:59.625
go to Taiwan, China

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:03.166
or

00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:09.166
go to heaven.

00:03:54.708 --> 00:03:55.833
This girl is pretty good.

00:04:22.416 --> 00:04:23.291
Hey.

00:04:23.958 --> 00:04:24.750
This one's nice.

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:26.375
Yeah.

00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:27.083
Let's go.

00:04:31.916 --> 00:04:32.666
Stop.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.083
What are you doing?

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:36.375
Sir.

00:04:37.208 --> 00:04:38.583
I'm a merchant. What's wrong?

00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:39.791
A merchant.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.791
Everyone's resisting the communists now.

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:44.500
Business? Who cares about business now?

00:04:48.083 --> 00:04:48.833
Sir.

00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:50.583
Even during war,

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:52.291
ordinary people still need to eat, right?

00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:54.500
Enough talk.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:55.500
Open the box.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.625
Don't touch my box.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.500
There's nothing inside, sir.

00:05:03.083 --> 00:05:03.500
Captain.

00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:04.458
Nothing here.

00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:06.708
Search him.

00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:09.708
I'm really just a merchant.

00:05:16.375 --> 00:05:17.500
Sir, see? There's nothing.

00:05:18.208 --> 00:05:19.083
Can I go now?

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.875
Sir.

00:05:21.625 --> 00:05:23.791
I'm truly a merchant, sir.

00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:29.083
Hey!

00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:33.958
This is for my mother's life.

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:34.541
Sir.

00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:35.541
That's valuable.

00:05:36.583 --> 00:05:38.375
It's for my mother's life, sir.

00:05:38.708 --> 00:05:39.708
Please, don't take it.

00:05:40.375 --> 00:05:40.916
Sir.

00:05:41.458 --> 00:05:42.083
Please, don't.

00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:43.500
Smuggling scarce supplies.

00:05:44.916 --> 00:05:46.500
Take him to build fortifications by the river.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.125
Sir.

00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:47.833
Move.

00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:48.583
Let me go.

00:05:48.958 --> 00:05:49.791
Let me go.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.333
Wait.

00:05:51.333 --> 00:05:51.833
Let me go.

00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:54.208
Hold on.

00:05:54.208 --> 00:05:54.833
Let me go.

00:05:57.291 --> 00:05:58.041
What's going on?

00:05:58.208 --> 00:05:58.750
Sir.

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:00.750
Someone at home is sick.

00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:02.625
I need to hurry home to save a life, sir.

00:06:06.458 --> 00:06:07.833
What kind of business do you do?

00:06:09.083 --> 00:06:10.083
I sell some local produce.

00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:11.500
Just a small business.

00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:14.833
Show me your hands.

00:06:27.875 --> 00:06:29.375
You're not a merchant at all.

00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:31.500
You're playing tricks.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.250
Sir, you've misunderstood. I wouldn't dare.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.500
Hey, what do you do?

00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:37.416
Hey, what do you do?

00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:39.291
I'm from the Ministry of Transportation.

00:06:41.125 --> 00:06:43.458
I suspect this person is involved in the power sabotage case.

00:06:43.958 --> 00:06:44.833
I need to take him away.

00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:53.375
Here, take him.

00:06:53.375 --> 00:06:55.041
Thank you, sir.

00:07:15.833 --> 00:07:16.708
Such bad luck.

00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:17.833
Ministry of Transportation.

00:07:20.125 --> 00:07:20.875
Go, go, go.

00:07:55.833 --> 00:07:56.875
Follow that car.

00:08:15.791 --> 00:08:17.333
There are eyes everywhere.

00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:18.791
You might be under surveillance.

00:08:21.958 --> 00:08:23.500
With you, the chief, here,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Let them watch.

00:08:25.333 --> 00:08:26.500
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:30.208
Jiaqi,

00:08:31.458 --> 00:08:32.375
Welcome to Nanjing.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.250
The teacher asked us to take good care of you.

00:08:35.666 --> 00:08:36.750
If you need anything, just say it.

00:08:37.541 --> 00:08:38.375
Sorry about today.

00:08:38.583 --> 00:08:39.625
Sorry for startling you, brother.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:40.958
I'll treat you tonight.

00:08:41.625 --> 00:08:43.125
A welcome dinner to calm your nerves.

00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:45.333
Actually,

00:08:45.958 --> 00:08:47.041
I do have something to ask you.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.083
We're like family.

00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:50.000
Just tell me what you need.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.083
This time,

00:08:52.458 --> 00:08:53.916
I want to acquire a machinery factory in Nanjing.

00:08:54.875 --> 00:08:56.041
Times are chaotic right now.

00:08:56.875 --> 00:08:58.125
But I think it's an opportunity.

00:08:59.666 --> 00:09:00.375
I'll keep an eye out for you.

00:09:00.875 --> 00:09:02.125
Factories in Nanjing are cheap now.

00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:02.916
They're all very affordable.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.541
That's easy.

00:09:04.916 --> 00:09:05.500
Well then,

00:09:05.625 --> 00:09:06.375
I'll trouble you, old friend.

00:09:07.916 --> 00:09:08.541
Don't mention it.

00:09:56.375 --> 00:09:57.041
Here.

00:09:57.625 --> 00:09:58.291
Room key.

00:09:59.416 --> 00:10:00.333
You'll stay here tonight.

00:10:00.916 --> 00:10:01.708
Take a rest first.

00:10:02.416 --> 00:10:03.541
I'll pick you up for dinner tonight.

00:10:04.083 --> 00:10:04.500
Okay.

00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:05.375
You can go back now.

00:10:15.875 --> 00:10:17.375
Welcome, sir.

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.458
Hello.

00:10:21.333 --> 00:10:22.333
Alright, please follow me.

00:10:22.541 --> 00:10:23.125
Okay, thank you.

00:10:23.125 --> 00:10:23.708
You're welcome.

00:11:13.458 --> 00:11:14.541
Welcome.

00:11:30.208 --> 00:11:31.333
Sorry, excuse me.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.000
Miss, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

00:11:53.208 --> 00:11:53.833
It's okay.
