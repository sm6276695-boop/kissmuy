[Between Love and Frost]

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.020
[Episode 5]

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.560
How is it? Still hurting?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.920
Huh?

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.120
No.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.950
You wrapped it up like a pro.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.120
Don't push yourself. Let me do it.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.360
If I hadn't saved you,

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.630
we wouldn't have

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.960
got along peacefully.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.150
Why did you save me?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.710
Even if you owe me your life,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.000
no need to risk your life to repay.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:43.750
Then what should I do?

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.710
Marry you?

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.360
Just a minor injury.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.360
Not that serious.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
You haven't answered me.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:55.150
How should I repay it?

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.360
Gu Tongpei,

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.630
as long as

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.150
you stay out of my actions,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.360
I promise I won't hurt you.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.280
We can

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.360
get along peacefully.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.470
Deal.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.560
Alright?

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.070
Never let anyone know

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.160
that I got injured,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.920
or my father will get to the bottom.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.240
Okay.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.190
I told you

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.870
not to act without permission.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.390
Did you tip off Chu Huaixuan?

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.160
Yes,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.270
it's me.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.560
I warned you long ago,

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.720
but you still go your own way.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.310
You should think clearly.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.120
Without my help,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.750
it's even hard for you to meet him.

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.430
Without my help,

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.750
you can't deal with Gu Tongpei, either.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.270
Are you sure you want to go against me?

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.510
This is to avenge Si.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.360
If you dare to hurt my men again,

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.600
I won't let you go easily.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.720
Everyone is here today.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:10.800
I heard that at the party yesterday,

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.510
you showed off your power

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.120
and changed the military suppliers

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.560
on your own initiative.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.920
They cut corners

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:20.750
and should have been replaced long ago.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:21.430
Confused!

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.000
They're our long-time partners.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.920
You should have solved problems
privately if any.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.680
How could you embarrass them in public?

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:32.680
Mr. Gu,

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.270
please calm down.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.160
In fact, what happened yesterday

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.560
was my plan with Tongpei.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:49.160
He wanted to use the chance

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.310
to warn those suppliers.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.160
He didn't mean
to cancel any cooperation.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.310
Just as she said.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.720
You really have sense,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.600
but being overly smart isn't good.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.720
Soon you'll be a member of this family.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.190
Always remember

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.390
to behave yourself.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.310
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.750
I see.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.040
And you.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.070
Remember to behave yourself.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:28.360
Yes, Father.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.870
Pei,

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.200
you're willful, impulsive

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.120
and unrepentant.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.870
You're punished
by copying Buddhist scriptures

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:39.320
to learn well how to calm your mind.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.550
You saw it.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.750
Father's word is law to Gu Tongpei.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.910
Only by working with me

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.510
can you avenge as soon as possible.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.320
You plotted against me.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:05.200
How dare you still bring it up?

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.340
What brings you here?

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.620
Your were injured.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.140
I don't think you can copy well,

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.180
so I came to help.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.300
Never expected that besides fighting,

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.740
you have the penmanship for it.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.020
Don't distract me.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.540
I have something serious later.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.540
[Do no evil]

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.100
Pei.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.020
What are you doing here?

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.020
I want to talk to you.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.940
Please give us a minute.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:46.940
I don't want outsiders

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.380
to hear about the business matters.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.620
You came at the wrong time.

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:52.340
Tongpei was punished to copy this.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.620
If I leave,

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.340
he'll be too busy to play with you.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:59.180
Just get to the point.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.620
My father transferred a batch
of military supplies

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.340
and wanted to do business with you.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:05.900
He said

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.020
he wanted to do something for soldiers

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.620
who have protected Jiang City.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.620
The money he earned is used
to do good deeds.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.380
He is really kind-hearted.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.780
Warehouse space has been tight lately.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.500
Once he secures a place,

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.020
you can go check the goods.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.740
This chance may draw out Chu Huaixuan.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.780
I know an available warehouse.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:31.940
I'll tell you the address later.

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.180
Then just go with Mr. Chu

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.340
to check goods.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:37.300
Thank you.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:38.940
You've been a huge help.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.340
Is she trying to attack Chu Huaixuan?

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:57.820
All is here.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.580
Thank you so much, Mr. Chu.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:02.940
Tongpei,

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:04.100
stop being so polite.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.620
It's part of my duty.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.580
Oh no! Fire outside!

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.460
Come and put out the fire! Quickly!

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.900
Let me check it out.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:29.780
Pull.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:43.460
Who are you?

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.140
What do you want to do?

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.020
Mr. Chu,

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:50.340
I have a question for you.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.180
When the Chu family was wiped out
a decade ago,

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.300
besides Mr. Liu, Mr. Sun and you,

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:56.700
who was the last man involved?

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:57.940
What Chu family?

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.340
Wiped out? I have no idea.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:18.420
Any bells ringing?

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:21.980
Who are you from the Chu family?

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.700
What's your relationship with them?

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.380
Answer

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.300
whatever I ask.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:29.260
Let go of me.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.500
I'll tell you.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:32.900
I will.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:35.980
Help.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:44.220
If you are so loyal,

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:45.780
pay penance

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.700
for him.

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.300
Hello.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.340
How is the goods handover going?

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.180
Haven't you gone out at all today?

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.260
Yes.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:51.740
You look pale.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.820
Are you not feeling well?

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.140
Do I? No way.

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:02.220
As expected,

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:03.580
you also went to the warehouse.

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.780
This is the evidence.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.700
Since you offered to help,

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:11.700
you've been using me

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:12.780
to capture Chu Huaixuan!

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.340
Yes.

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.900
Why did you want to kill him?

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.140
None of your business.

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.340
I'm doing this for you.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.940
