00:01:27.625 --> 00:01:28.166
Madam

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.416
Where are you going again?

00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:32.083
I'm not going anywhere.

00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:33.916
I was just checking if Madam was back.

00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:35.625
Back yet? Back yet?

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:37.291
What kind of Commander are you?

00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:38.625
Look at this, just look.

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.458
There are eyes everywhere.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.416
How am I supposed to live like this?

00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:36.541
The fighting in the north is getting intense.

00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:38.875
The Communist Army will cross the river any day now.

00:02:39.708 --> 00:02:40.916
People in the Nanjing Government are anxious.

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:43.791
That anxiety follows us too.

00:02:46.125 --> 00:02:46.875
Isn't that right?

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:48.625
Are they going to send us to Taiwan, China?

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:50.041
No.

00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:53.333
No.

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:55.958
Taiwan, China is such a tiny place.

00:02:55.958 --> 00:02:56.833
What could we do there?

00:02:57.666 --> 00:02:58.416
We're not going anywhere.

00:03:00.708 --> 00:03:01.333
Let's wait and see.

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:02.416
Whether we go or not,

00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:04.375
I'm afraid it's not up to you.

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:18.333
Welcome to both of you.

00:03:19.625 --> 00:03:20.000
Hello, hello.

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:22.541
This is my wife.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.583
Nice to meet you, Madam.

00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:24.541
Nice to meet you both.

00:03:26.083 --> 00:03:26.583
I'm not sure

00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:27.791
how I should address you.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.791
Mr. Zhao or Boss Zhao?

00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:31.291
You're too kind.

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:32.708
How about thisâ€”

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.083
You're five years older than me.

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:35.125
I think

00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:37.416
you should call me younger brother.

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:40.791
A few days ago,

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:42.708
I had the honor of meeting your party's

00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:44.458
main leader in the Nanjing Municipal Committee.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.875
They mentioned you to me.

00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:47.458
It's a pleasure to meet you today.

00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:48.416
Nice to meet you.

00:03:50.166 --> 00:03:51.083
As for me,

00:03:51.166 --> 00:03:52.250
I specially brought you

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.500
this northeastern ginseng

00:03:53.708 --> 00:03:54.583
and wild deer antler.

00:03:55.083 --> 00:03:57.041
I also prepared for Madam

00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:59.166
a black pearl necklace from earlier years.

00:04:00.625 --> 00:04:01.458
It's just a small token of respect.

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:02.166
Boss Zhao,

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:03.750
you're too generous.

00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:05.000
Please, have a seat.

00:04:05.166 --> 00:04:05.791
Thank you, after you.

00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:13.583
Commander Wang,

00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:15.791
you're a very busy man.

00:04:16.791 --> 00:04:19.041
I've wanted to visit you for a long time.

00:04:20.083 --> 00:04:20.416
But you see,

00:04:21.916 --> 00:04:23.000
it's been delayed until today.

00:04:23.875 --> 00:04:24.791
I'm truly sorry.

00:04:27.375 --> 00:04:28.166
Usually it's fine,

00:04:28.916 --> 00:04:30.291
but lately there's been a lot going on.

00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:33.083
Meetings at the Ministry of National Defense,

00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:35.541
meetings at the Garrison Command,

00:04:36.083 --> 00:04:38.250
and meetings at the Defense Command too.

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:41.625
All these meetings,

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.041
it's always about the same things.

00:04:44.458 --> 00:04:45.333
Commander Wang

00:04:45.541 --> 00:04:46.875
has been thinking about Boss Zhao for a long time.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.791
Boss Zhao

00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:49.833
has also wanted to visit Commander Wang for ages.

00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:51.000
Right now,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.416
the two of them are truly

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:53.791
heroes meeting,

00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:55.333
admiring each other.

00:04:56.625 --> 00:04:57.500
Mingyu, I must say,

00:04:58.333 --> 00:05:00.250
this is all your fault.

00:05:00.875 --> 00:05:02.291
Why didn't you introduce us sooner?

00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:03.666
Brother Zhao,

00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:05.333
now is just right.

00:05:05.708 --> 00:05:07.375
Everything has worked out for the best.

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:28.041
The situation on the battlefield between the Nationalists and Communists is now clear.

00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:31.250
This war is close to ending.

00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:33.458
It won't be much longer.

00:05:35.583 --> 00:05:36.041
Commander Wang,

00:05:37.083 --> 00:05:37.750
Zhao Jiaqi

00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:39.000
has always been on the front lines.

00:05:39.416 --> 00:05:40.083
He is very experienced.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:41.458
He came today

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:43.291
to discuss your next steps.

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:44.583
The goal

00:05:44.875 --> 00:05:46.166
is to cooperate with your work.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.583
Actually, I've thought about this before.

00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:54.083
Right now,

00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:57.666
the Nationalist Army leadership is preparing their escape routes.

00:05:59.875 --> 00:06:01.000
Some want to go to Taiwan, China.

00:06:01.958 --> 00:06:03.166
Some want to go to the United States.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.125
Or Hong Kong, China.

00:06:06.333 --> 00:06:07.541
Military ships and vehicles

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.916
have become their personal tools.

00:06:13.291 --> 00:06:13.916
Jiaqi,

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:15.500
Commander Wang,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:16.708
I have two concerns now.

00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:18.625
First,

00:06:18.833 --> 00:06:19.666
I've followed Chiang for many years.

00:06:20.125 --> 00:06:22.416
I still feel grateful for Chiang's recognition.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:24.166
Second,

00:06:24.583 --> 00:06:25.625
I'm unsure about your side's policies.

00:06:26.125 --> 00:06:26.875
I'm not certain about them yet.

00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:30.625
Commander Wang,

00:06:31.916 --> 00:06:33.250
Allow me to speak frankly.

00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:35.083
The Nationalist Party is

00:06:35.083 --> 00:06:35.916
demoralized,

00:06:37.291 --> 00:06:38.250
and the government is corrupt.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.458
Only by overthrowing this government

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.375
can our nation have hope.

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:49.750
Commander Wang, rest assured.

00:06:51.125 --> 00:06:52.166
Our Party will remember

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.208
those who contribute to our country and people.

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:57.250
Of course,

00:06:58.125 --> 00:06:59.333
we also hope you,

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.666
can switch sides.

00:07:02.458 --> 00:07:03.958
Join us in building a new China.

00:07:07.666 --> 00:07:08.875
Your 79th Division

00:07:09.416 --> 00:07:11.875
if it joins the People's Liberation Army,

00:07:13.291 --> 00:07:15.166
it will be a great contribution to the millions in Nanjing

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.166
and to the entire Chinese nation.

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:23.791
The Commander of the East China Field Army has repeatedly asked us

00:07:24.208 --> 00:07:25.541
to do our utmost

00:07:27.041 --> 00:07:28.666
to minimize damage to Nanjing

00:07:29.708 --> 00:07:32.333
and reduce civilian and soldier casualties.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:34.833
To avoid unnecessary suffering.

00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:38.208
Meeting you today,

00:07:39.541 --> 00:07:41.000
I am here on the commander's orders

00:07:41.583 --> 00:07:42.291
to cooperate

00:07:42.625 --> 00:07:44.250
and assist with your next steps.

00:07:46.458 --> 00:07:47.125
Sincerely,

00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:48.916
we welcome you to join us.

00:08:06.833 --> 00:08:08.083
Although I am a soldier,

00:08:09.291 --> 00:08:10.333
I love peace even more.

00:08:11.958 --> 00:08:14.083
I hope these days will end soon.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.041
Come,

00:08:16.708 --> 00:08:17.166
I propose

00:08:17.458 --> 00:08:17.833
we

00:08:18.166 --> 00:08:18.708
use water instead of wine

00:08:22.583 --> 00:08:25.041
to wish for the early liberation of Nanjing and all of China.

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:26.041
Cheers!

00:08:26.375 --> 00:08:26.625
Cheers!

00:08:35.625 --> 00:08:36.458
Wait, wait.

00:08:41.083 --> 00:08:41.333
Hey!

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.458
I'm not dead yet.

00:08:48.708 --> 00:08:49.166
What are you doing?

00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:51.791
Are you trying to rebel?

00:09:00.625 --> 00:09:01.166
Excuse me, you two,

00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:02.666
please come with me.

00:09:05.166 --> 00:09:05.458
Please.
