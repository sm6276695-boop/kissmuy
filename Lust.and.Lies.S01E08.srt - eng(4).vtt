Rings puzzle for sale!

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:38.439
I want one.

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:40.200
If you solve it
before the temple fair ends,

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.240
there's a prize.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.399
Here's the money.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:45.560
Sure.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.240
Here you go.

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:49.119
If you can open it,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.840
you'll get a cute kitten.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.759
Come back to me when you've solved it.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.280
Here.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.759
Come take a look.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:59.600
This is so difficult.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.200
I guess I won't win the prize.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.480
Mister, buy some fresh flowers.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.920
Miss is so pretty.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.920
Put me down.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.120
All right.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.079
Thank you, miss.

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:21.680
Lianhua

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.640
grows in the harshest places,

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.640
yet blooms the most beautifully.

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.319
I don't like Lianhua.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.400
Why not?

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.760
Because

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.000
my mother died in Lianhua.

The silver-throwing ceremony begins.

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:03.680
Let's spread ingots!

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.840
Come on.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.220
Let's go take a look.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.390
The silver-throwing ceremony
is starting.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:14.400
Miss Ruan sends out an order.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.199
If the Huo Army intervenes,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.560
kill Huo Xiu

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.479
and fall back.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:19.080
Yes.

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.180
Let's wait a little longer.

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.400
Move out now.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.919
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:50.680
Let's make a fortune.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.530
Wishing everyone wealth.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.800
Come on.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.479
Spread the ingots.

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:15.039
May riches pour in!

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.240
Wishing you great wealth!

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.000
Let's make a fortune.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.680
Stay close to me.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.360
Listen up.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.199
There must be no mistakes tonight.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.759
Hold there.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.279
Stay close to me.

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:37.800
Turn around.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.480
Come.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.000
Stand still.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.879
Don't move.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.680
Stand here.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.319
Fire!

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.959
Fire!

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.800
Fire!

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.920
Fire!

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.040
Run!

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:02.439
Don't shoot!

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.560
Don't hurt the people.

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:15.000
Huo Xiu,

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:16.680
my leg hurts.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.399
Huo Xiu.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.120
Retreat.

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:23.720
Go.

00:08:48.679 --> 00:08:49.480
Young Marshal!

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:51.879
Young Marshal.

00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:53.639
Young Marshal.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.320
Find out

00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:08.440
who sent

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:09.440
those assassins.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.120
You were amazing, Miss Ruan.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.039
Not only did we move the goods out,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.039
but we also gave
the Huo Army a hard time.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:15.720
Yeah.

00:09:24.759 --> 00:09:26.399
Rework the gunpowder and weapons

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.600
as fast as possible.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:28.960
Huo Beishan

00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:31.320
will definitely track down
the smuggled goods.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.799
Don't leave any traces.

00:09:32.919 --> 00:09:33.360
Understood.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.840
The Huo Army arrived too fast,

00:09:43.559 --> 00:09:44.960
and Huo Xiu got away.

00:09:45.559 --> 00:09:46.200
But

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.039
he's wounded.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.399
Ever since you met her,

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.240
you've been getting hurt

00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:56.200
nonstop.

00:09:58.759 --> 00:10:00.279
The temple fair was ruined,

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.399
and the Huo Army took heavy losses.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.679
You know

00:10:05.919 --> 00:10:06.519
Governor

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.360
will come after you soon.

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:14.039
Drink it.

00:10:14.879 --> 00:10:15.440
Where is she?

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:19.759
She disappeared after you got hurt.

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.200
You took the stab

00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:22.039
for nothing.

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:23.639
She doesn't care about you at all.

00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:36.320
What a hypocrite.
