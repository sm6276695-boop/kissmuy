[Between Love and Frost]

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.020
[Episode 20]

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.500
So,

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.980
aren't you going to shoot me?

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:37.260
Mr. Gu,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.500
we are husband and wife, after all.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.100
Even though the marriage is fake,

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.940
you've given me and Hongdou

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.180
a place to stay.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.300
You are the pillar
that holds up this home.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.300
Becoming sensible?

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.180
Rest assured,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.100
just be good,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.060
and you and Hongdou will live well.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.540
I even prepared a surprise for you.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.060
Come in.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.420
Chu Huaixuan

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.940
is now a trusted aide
who makes money for me.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.940
He's one of us.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.140
Hongdou should be waking from her nap.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.820
Go check on her.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.780
You must've heard

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.740
on the way back.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.740
Tongpei smashed our opium den.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.700
This business can't go on anymore.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.460
Mr. Gu,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.900
don't worry,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.020
I've arranged everything.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.460
In some time,

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.340
a wealthy merchant named Jiu

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.660
will be attending a charity banquet.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.700
As long as we build
a connection with him,

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.340
we can make up for all the losses

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.340
we suffered before.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.020
Good.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.100
[Palace of Joy]

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.980
Chu Huaixuan is still alive.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.060
You know it too?

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.020
Too?

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.900
So Chu Yan told you.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.060
Pei,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.460
my father is working for Gu Tongce.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.260
I know you're looking for leverage
against him.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.940
I can help you.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:24.860
Let's work together

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.220
to kill Chu Huaixuan.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.140
Why do you suddenly want
to work with me?

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.500
Aren't you afraid

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.100
his close ties with Gu Tongce

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.780
will affect Tongce?

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.580
Chu Huaixuan is my enemy.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.980
He deserves to die.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.460
As for Ce...

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.140
Chu Huaixuan has everything to do

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.380
with the opium.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.580
Eliminating him

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.540
will only benefit
my husband's reputation.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.140
In that case,

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.900
what benefit is there for me

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.500
if I help you?

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.540
If you're unwilling to help,

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.700
then forget it.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.340
I only asked what benefit I can get.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.180
I never said I wouldn't help.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.980
You know it.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.900
I can't refuse your request.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.740
Chu Huaixuan and Ce

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.260
want to seek help
from a wealthy merchant

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.500
named Jiu.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.300
Telling me this,

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.260
aren't you worried I'll go and ruin it?

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.380
Then let's wait and see.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.180
Pei, are you looking forward
to meeting Jiu?

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.300
What do you plan to do?

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.740
He is a mysterious person.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.860
I only managed to trace
a few business dealings,

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.460
nothing else.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.140
I'll just have to play it by ear.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.940
That is Jiu.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.260
Jiu, your reputation precedes you.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:26.900
I am Chu Huaixuan.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.300
Allow me to introduce you

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.500
to the famed Military Governor

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.140
of Jiang City.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.260
Jiu.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:37.900
This

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.900
is Mrs. Gu, right?

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.740
How beautiful and graceful.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.940
Like an old friend.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.540
Jiu appreciates you.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.900
Hurry and offer him a toast.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.020
Apologies,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:56.660
I'm unwell

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.780
and can't drink alcohol.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:58.620
Minghui,

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.340
with Jiu's kindness,

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.140
you should drink some.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.900
No, Mr. Gu,

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.300
you don't get it.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.940
I especially adore

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.260
this kind of aloof beauty.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.300
Makes me want to cherish her.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.860
Jiu,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.300
we came here
to sincerely discuss cooperation.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.940
Where's the sincerity?

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:26.060
Mr. Gu, you'd better show me some.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.300
If not,

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:31.300
Mrs. Gu can do it on your behalf.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:33.660
Right, right.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:42.900
Sorry, Mrs. Gu.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.060
Sorry, Mrs. Gu.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.300
Shall I take you down to get changed?

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:49.500
Let go!

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.220
Come on.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:54.860
You're not even drunk.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.180
Why push your wife out
to entertain people?

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:03.660
Jiu, right?

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:04.900
I'll drink this

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.900
on my sister-in-law's behalf.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.580
When men bring women to banquets,

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.780
it's so they can serve
a special purpose.

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.980
Women serving men is only natural.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.740
Do you still think
you're a businesswoman?

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.780
A woman doing business
is nothing but a joke.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:31.500
Don't be ungrateful.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:34.260
Who says women can't do business?

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:50.100
You...

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:51.860
You...

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:53.900
What are you doing here?

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.980
This isn't your place to speak.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:59.260
Jiu, my apologies.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.380
Today's poor arrangements were my fault.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.460
Please accept my apology.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.900
Jiu, good evening.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:13.900
Sorry.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.300
For my little joke.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.740
Normally I prefer not to show myself.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.780
But Mr. Chu here said

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.580
Mr. Gu was sincerely
seeking cooperation.

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:24.740
That's why I came today.

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.980
However,

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.900
in business,

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:30.740
character is what counts.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.780
And everyone has seen
what kind of man Mr. Gu is.

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:36.540
No matter how sincere you claim to be,

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.100
you're still nothing but rotten cabbage.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.780
I won't be doing this deal.

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:42.380
You...

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.300
Pei, I'll do whatever you say.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.900
Don't think that just because
you paid my medical bills,

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.780
I'll be grateful to you.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.660
Look at you now. How pathetic.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.100
How does it feel
to be treated like an object,

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:37.260
toyed with by people?

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:39.580
Nothing much.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.060
I'm used to it.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.540
For a woman to rise to Jiu,

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:48.660
you must have endured plenty.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.700
Don't be hypocritical with me here.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:53.620
Now,

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:55.780
I'm the one who suits Pei best.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.900
A bit of suffering is nothing.

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.540
But as for you,

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.380
if you want to kill Chu Huaixuan,
just do it.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.700
Don't use it as an excuse
to get close to Pei.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.020
Isn't he your father?

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:10.100
Don't you bring that up!

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.940
He doesn't deserve to be my father.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:18.780
Why...

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.140
pretend to be weak?

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.540
Crash into them to kill them all.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:25.300
Pei, are you waiting for me?

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:28.340
When you were with Chu Minghui,

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.500
what did you say to her?

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:31.980
Nothing.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.460
I only told her

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.740
to stay away from you.

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:41.620
Right now,
she'll only bring you trouble.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.460
I'm the one who can truly help you.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.460
She hurt you so badly.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.140
Don't you mind at all?

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.580
All I care about is whether she's happy.

00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.780
Idiot.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.900
Someone like me now

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.660
isn't worth it.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.020
Chu Minghui.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:14.860
Chu Minghui.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.460
I'm tired.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.700
Whatever it is, leave it for tomorrow.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.980
Gu Tongpei played the hero again today.

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.540
You're pleased, aren't you?

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:26.100
You hate me even more, don't you?

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.740
Just how afraid of Gu Tongpei are you

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.740
to care about his every move like this?

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:35.260
Afraid of him?

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.620
I'll be the one who wins in the end.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:41.180
I'll make sure

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.900
you see me trample Gu Tongpei underfoot.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.180
Mr. Gu Tongce is hosting
a family banquet at the dining hall

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.980
for you and Miss Chu Yan.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.620
He's tied up with official duties

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:54.820
and can't get away for now.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.300
Please feel free.

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.740
What is it, Hongdou?

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.500
Here, give it to me.

00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:53.500
Hongdou saw you were injured

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:54.740
and wanted to help put on the ointment.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:56.020
But she couldn't reach,

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.980
so she asked me to help.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:00.420
So I helped you with the ointment.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.900
She's little and naive.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.620
Sorry to trouble you.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.580
There's no need to be so polite with me.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.180
It's still improper for you to be here.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:16.580
Since the ointment's been applied,

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:18.540
please leave.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:23.140
No, Mother, I see more wounds.

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:23.860
