[Between Love and Frost]

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.020
[Episode 16]

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.640
I've been too busy
since the succession.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.870
Do you need me, Tongpei?

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.760
Tongce,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.640
the day Father died,

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.790
you also went to the old mansion,
didn't you?

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.230
I had always believed

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.430
Chu Minghui was the murderer.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.950
Not until today did I learn the truth

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.760
that Father actually died
of a bullet to the chest.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.400
Since Chu Minghui had set traps,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.150
why bother shooting him?

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.350
And if she did use a gun,

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.760
why cover it up with burn marks?

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.040
There's only one truth.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.590
You also went there that day.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.510
You knocked out Chu Minghui,

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.120
killed Father,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.640
and framed her.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.710
You even used her traps

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.120
to cover your crime.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.150
Ce!

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.910
What took you so long?

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:13.800
Save me, now!

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.800
A re-examination of Father's body

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.430
will expose your forged autopsy report.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.400
Do you have anything else to say?

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.870
Tongpei,

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.360
I admit it.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.360
I killed Father.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.400
But think about it.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.840
How did Father treat me all those years?

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.560
He was the one who took me in.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.910
Yet I had to do everything perfectly

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.120
just to please him.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.430
But him?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.910
He treated me like a dog.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.400
When he was happy, he tossed me a bone.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.710
When he wasn't, he beat and scolded me.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.710
I even had to be beaten and cursed

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.910
for the mistakes you made.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.150
Was he never wrong?

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.000
Just because of this,
you killed him?

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.030
Tongpei,

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.360
no matter what,

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.000
it's my fault.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.840
I'm sorry.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.150
But think again.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.630
We're the only two left in this family.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.120
We are brothers.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.160
Father taught us from childhood

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.120
to show no mercy to enemies.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.680
When you go down there,
don't forget to tell him

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.920
it was me who killed you.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.120
This time,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.360
he will surely be proud of me.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.270
It's all right.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:52.190
It's a good sign.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.560
Leave it.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.830
I'll clean up later.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.600
How long have they been out?

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.310
Why haven't they come back yet?

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.120
You still have feelings
for him, don't you?

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.160
Why bother fighting like that?

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:14.920
You young people
just make trouble for nothing.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.120
You're not well. Let me do it.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.360
Coming.

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.120
Coming.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.920
Die? Just come in.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.160
Why knock?

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.070
Get in!

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.120
Qiao...

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.160
Who are you?

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.630
Trespassing is a crime.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:06:59.240
Search!

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.920
Yes, sir.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.600
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.310
You can't knowingly break the law.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.160
You...

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.680
Interesting.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.800
Chu Minghui,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.270
looks like I'll have to
come after you myself.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:24.950
Gu Tongpei was truly ruthless,

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:27.240
wounding you like this.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.310
But don't worry.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.920
I promised

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.600
I would avenge you.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:36.150
I've already killed him.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.030
What did you say?

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.200
Where is Pei?

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:45.360
What have you done to him?

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.240
I am the Military Governor now.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:59.960
And you are mine too.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.510
The child too

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:05.720
is mine.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.750
From now on,

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.440
you'll take care of the child.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.320
The three of us

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.600
will live a good life together.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.360
You'll be a good mother,

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.550
and I'll be a good father.

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.260
[Four years later]

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.030
Hongdou.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.440
Little one.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:11.670
Where are you hiding?

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:13.030
I can't find you.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.030
Hongdou.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.240
Little one.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.320
Little one.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.360
Where are you hiding?

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:27.670
Why

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.240
can't I find you?

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.000
You're so good. You found me.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.790
You are the best.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.790
Next time we play hide and seek,

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.910
can you give me a chance

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.240
so I can find you a bit faster?

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.120
Then keep your word.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.000
That's a promise, all right?

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.550
Little one.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.600
Hongdou,

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:07.870
look.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:09.550
Pinwheels.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.870
Hongdou,

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.320
you haven't called me Father today.

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:15.550
Let me hear it.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.440
Father.

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:18.750
Good girl.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:21.550
Father is bad.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.320
Hongdou, how about this?

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.910
If you ask Mother to give me a kiss,

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.240
then I'll give it to you.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:32.120
Mother...

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.390
Here you are.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:52.630
- Yay! Pinwheels!
- Go.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.600
Look at you.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.560
It's been a few years.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:11.960
Even the child has grown.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.550
You're still so hot-tempered.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:15.750
This evening,

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.600
the Inspector of the Three Provinces
would send a new Military Commissioner.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:22.750
Get yourself ready
and attend the banquet with me.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.240
I'm not going.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.630
I have to go
for a hospital check-up today.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.960
That won't take long.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.320
Normally, you can avoid showing up
as the Military Governor's wife.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.200
But this is an important occasion.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.030
You must attend.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.840
On such an occasion,

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.240
you, a mighty Military Governor,

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:42.230
need a woman
to hold up your prestige?

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.580
You're not just any woman.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.020
Those wives of officers
and businessmen,

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.180
even all combined,

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.820
do not compare to what you once were.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.660
But I'm nothing but a loser now.

00:13:58.940 --> 00:13:59.740
A loser?

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.220
And a loser still keeps running away.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:04.020
Let me see.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:06.260
How many times
have you tried to run this year?

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.020
Seems

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.860
I caught you every time, didn't I?

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.340
You are well aware.

00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:15.580
The entire city is
in my soldiers' hands.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:18.460
Be good tonight.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.580
Don't waste your strength.

00:14:33.740 --> 00:14:36.700
[Cunji Hospital of Jiang City]

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:47.980
Your condition has worsened a lot.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:49.980
Let's stick to the usual.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.340
Give me a painkiller injection.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:53.660
No, I'll prescribe you some medicine

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.620
with a higher dosage.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.660
I said it's fine.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.940
I know my own body best.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.980
The painkiller injection
may ease the pain,

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.660
but it will also increase
the strain on your heart.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.340
With your current condition,

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.380
you really can't use it anymore.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:09.820
Otherwise, you could be in danger
at any moment.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.300
It seems

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:13.980
I don't have much time left.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:23.900
Come in.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:30.740
Mr. Gu.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.060
What,

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.380
did he refuse to accept it?

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.460
We couldn't even get in.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.540
His servant said

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.180
he only meets people

00:15:48.340 --> 00:15:50.060
at the agreed-upon time.

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:54.620
As a mere Military Commissioner,

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.940
he's putting on quite the airs.

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:58.740
Isn't he just here to line his pockets?

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.180
Now that he won't take the tea,

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.380
replace it with wine crates.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:05.780
Fill them with gold bars
and send them over.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.820
Get rid of him quickly

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:08.940
before he causes any annoyance.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:11.140
Go.
