00:00:06.016 --> 00:00:08.960
=Spring Fever=
=Episode 3=

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.200
Madam.

00:00:10.496 --> 00:00:11.400
Speak.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.560
The Governor-General
surnamed Shen claimed

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.920
the Young Lord has campaigned
in the southwest for years

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.320
and now returns victorious.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.040
He sought the Emperor's decree

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.200
to come to Ningzhou

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.600
to pay respects at the cenotaph
of Princess He'an

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.600
(Chenghuan, Dowager Lu's Maid)
and renovate the Duting Station.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.600
(Dowager Lu)
Duting Station again.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.680
What did Xia Ciyi say?

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.000
Prefect Xia said when Princess He'an,
the late mother of the Young Lord,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.800
returned to Bianzhou to visit relatives

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.080
and passed Ningzhou,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.280
she was poisoned by the postmaster
at Duting Station.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.920
He has regretted that.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.160
Enough.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.200
Isn't it the same old excuses

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.680
to shift the blame?

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.200
Madam, would you like to check it out?

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.440
No.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.680
I'm old

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.320
and tired.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.000
Let the younger ones

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.280
handle domestic affairs.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.928
My lord.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.600
I've examined the fetus.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.280
The fetus had already died

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.680
inside the womb days prior.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:23.640
What?

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.000
Jinzhi,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.080
is what he says true?

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.960
Were you aware?

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.384
Impossible!

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.240
It must be this vile woman's doing!

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.520
I was carrying the child.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.720
How could I not know his condition?

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.840
Well said.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.640
Since you were carrying the child,

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.160
that means

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.320
you must have known the truth.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.040
It wasn't a misunderstanding,
but deliberate slander.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.760
In that case,

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.440
those two ruffians at the temple

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.640
must have been accomplices your hired.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.920
What ruffians?

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.640
(He might not sincerely help me.)

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.880
(If we openly clash now and he leaves,)

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.640
(I might suffer a lot.)

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.936
My lord,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.600
there were no ruffians.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.040
It was merely those assassins

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.040
fighting among themselves.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.720
My lady,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.800
you didn't frame me.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.680
There must be some misunderstanding.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.080
Right, a misunderstanding.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.880
Very well.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.280
Since the victim makes no accusation,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.040
then I

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.640
shall not press further.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.560
However, Lord Xia,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.160
you nearly took a life

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.520
over a mere misunderstanding.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.880
If this reaches the Imperial Court,

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.640
people might praise Ningzhou Prefecture

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.160
for its exemplary law enforcement.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.360
Then

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.480
per your suggestion,

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.600
how should I resolve this?

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.520
I have no demands.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.200
But

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.240
with so many witnesses today

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.000
and tongues wagging,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.520
it'll be hard to silence them all.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.432
Especially Lord Gao.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.640
We have numerous subordinates.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.440
I'll have someone take boxes back,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.120
clean thoroughly,

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.080
and return them to you.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.040
Then I'll trouble you with this.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:39.760
My duty.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.240
Protect this woman.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.400
As the sole eyewitness
to the assassination attempt,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.320
for the Young Lord's safety,

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.160
I need constant access
to interrogate her.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.200
Yes.

00:04:03.904 --> 00:04:05.312
(Prefect's Mansion)

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.120
My lord, he accepted everything
in the carriage.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.040
(Jia Wu, Prefect's confidant)
This Governor-General is quite greedy.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.240
The fact that he dares show such greed

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.600
actually reassures me.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.240
My lord, Princess He'an
has been dead for years.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.280
Why would the Young Lord
come to mourn now?

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.320
Set aside the Young Lord's matters.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.960
We need to get to know more

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.000
about the Governor-General first.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.120
Inform our contacts

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.200
to behave themselves these days.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.104
Understood.

00:04:45.344 --> 00:04:48.120
My lord, the Duting Station connects
to the Lu Residence's back door.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.280
It's accessible
through Lady Ye's courtyard.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.520
I see.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.184
Whoa.

00:04:53.184 --> 00:04:54.656
(Duting Station)

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.680
My lord, we're here.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.696
(Duting Station)

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.240
- Greetings, Young Lord.
- Greetings, Young Lord.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.960
Remember. Don't call him
Young Lord in Ningzhou.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.520
(Duting Station)
Call him Lord Shen,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.400
the Governor-General.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.800
- Yes, Lord Shen.
- Yes, Lord Shen.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.480
(Lu Residence)
(Mother, I'll uncover how you died.)

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.760
- Shut up! Get out!
- Dr. Leng is the best in Ningzhou.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.720
Best? He's just a quack!

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.360
Find me the real best one!

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.200
Or ask my father to find
imperial physicians from the capital.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:41.600
All of you, get out!

00:05:45.216 --> 00:05:47.280
Dr. Leng, what happened?

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.600
How did you injure your head?

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.320
I got beaten by Lady Jinzhi.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.448
Dr. Leng.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.720
Dr. Leng.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.640
Dr. Leng, Jinzhi just miscarried.
Her temper is understandable.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.080
Please bear with her.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.680
Here's all your payment.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.160
Don't take offense.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.680
Thank you, Madam Lu.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.040
Madam Lu, I need to verify something.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.200
Speak freely.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.960
In your household,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.064
was there any specific requirement
regarding the child's birthdate?

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.640
It might be

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:22.760
that the Dowager deeply misses her son,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.200
my late husband.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.480
Since Jinzhi's due date

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.560
coincided with his birthdate,

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.440
the Dowager has often wished

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.800
her grandson could share his birthdate.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.840
Lady Jinzhi's miscarriage

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.840
was caused
by an anti-miscarriage medicine.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.040
Anti-miscarriage?

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.120
Exactly. This type of medicine

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.600
can induce labor
through dosage adjustments

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.600
or delay delivery.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:51.440
Used properly, it prevents miscarriage.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.600
If used improperly,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
it becomes poison.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.480
Moreover, the misuse of medicine
damaged her body.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.720
She may never conceive again.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.560
What?

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:05.840
Never conceive again?

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.400
Precisely.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.416
Otherwise,

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.920
why would she have driven me out?

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.440
Enough, Dr. Leng.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.760
This concerns
the Lu family's reputation.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.800
Consider you never come.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.680
You'll be generously compensated.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.480
Rest assured.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.600
I'll take my leave now.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.960
- Be careful, Dr. Leng.
- Okay.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.720
I am busy. I won't see you out.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:26.680
Okay.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.440
(My good intentions backfired.)

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.640
(But the Lu lineage must continue.)

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.680
(Maybe Shi'an and Ye Qinglan should...)

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.800
(My child, I failed to protect you.)

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.320
(But)

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.600
(I won't let your death be in vain.)

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.760
(Those people will pay the price.)

00:08:09.344 --> 00:08:12.992
(Lu Residence)

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.760
Why are you here?

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.120
I've fulfilled

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.760
the favor you asked.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.680
Now, tell me

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.960
about the tattoo.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.200
Two months ago,

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.680
at the docks...

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.640
Hurry! Hurry up!

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.696
- After him!
- Help!

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.840
Don't chase!

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:15.920
- Help!
- Stop!

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.304
Don't run!

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.696
Stop.

00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.744
Step aside.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.320
As a pearler,

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.840
you can't take payment
without fulfilling your duty.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.552
Sir, I'll return the money.
I don't want to die.

00:09:39.552 --> 00:09:40.480
I don't want the money.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.120
I want what's mine!

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.680
You dare take my things.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:51.808
You court death!

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.600
Let's go.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.280
In Ningzhou,

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.360
those engaging in the pearl trade

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.280
are called pearlers.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.240
Killing people in public.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.760
What about the corpse?

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.560
None dare investigate.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.760
And no one dares to say it.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.160
The rest

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.560
depends on whether

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.240
you have the courage to investigate.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.120
Today, I was there.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:31.200
Why didn't you tell them

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.080
that the lecher

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.280
was framing you?

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.600
You won't stay in Ningzhou forever.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.560
If I take advantage of this matter

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.920
and offend Xia Jinzhi,

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.720
after you leave,

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.760
she'll retaliate.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.120
Admitting there was a lecher
in the temple

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.480
only adds another stain
to my reputation.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.680
Moreover,

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.560
you were not truly
helping me seek justice.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.600
You were just exploiting this leverage

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.240
to extort money from Prefect Xia.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.040
What exactly is the stain

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.400
you mentioned earlier?

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.640
When women face such situations,

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.640
though completely innocent,

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.360
they become more despised

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.760
than the actual wrongdoers.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.960
Then why don't you leave this place?

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.400
There's something here
I can't let go of.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.760
You can't let go of your man,

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.480
or the wealth and glory?

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.960
You're a mere slave.
If you keep spouting lies,

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:09.952
I'll make sure
you don't survive tonight.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.080
Stay back!

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.960
If you touch me again,

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.680
I'll kill you.
