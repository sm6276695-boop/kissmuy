=Lust and Lies=

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.880
What?

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.520
Carry on.

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:59.000
I'm not stupid.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.679
I won't kill you here.

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:05.519
Then I look forward to

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:07.920
where you'll try to kill me.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.120
Do you?

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:13.799
Well, I'll have to
think about it carefully.

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:16.799
If you're here to look for something,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.599
you'd better behave.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.920
This is the Huo Residence, after all.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.640
Your life won't be easy here.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.879
What are you talking about?

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.920
It's the Huo family who traps me here.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.959
I don't want to stay here.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:40.480
My dear sister,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.519
you're so amusing.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.640
I hope you'll stay.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.780
=Episode 5=

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.439
Jin is back.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.940
(Huo Jin, Young Master
of the Huo family)

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.800
Jin's been studying abroad.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.159
As soon as he heard you were back,

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.879
he came back to see you.

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:15.400
Don't put on that smile.

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:16.919
I don't believe you're my sister.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.439
Don't mind him.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.439
Jin's just acting tough.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.039
He has prepared Western food for you.

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.960
Really?

00:03:51.919 --> 00:03:53.560
I'll leave this black snake

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:54.840
to you, Xiu.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.919
Miss Huo is amazing.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.240
She's not afraid of snakes.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:07.080
Yeah.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.800
Look.

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:17.000
Qingwan is Jin's favorite.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.000
That day she disappeared,

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:20.800
they were playing hide-and-seek.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.560
Jin hid in a cabinet the whole night,

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:25.480
but Qingwan didn't come looking for him.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.879
He thought

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:28.759
she didn't want him anymore.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.680
To him,

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.040
no one can replace Qingwan.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.040
I am Qingwan.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.160
Exactly.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.639
That's why he's acting like a child.

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:22.800
Go back.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.090
Are you waiting to be pushed again?

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:27.480
I still have something to do.

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:56.439
Put me down.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.519
What's your problem?

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.600
You're the young master
of the Huo family,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.720
yet you bully a woman.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.160
You're so petty.

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:18.199
Qingwan is the most important person
to me.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.560
How dare a performer like you
pretend to be her?

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.000
I must teach you a lesson.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.639
You studied abroad, didn't you?

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:26.000
But you haven't even learn respect.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.879
Did you throw away all manners?

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:32.680
You hook up with Huo Xiu.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.920
Why should I respect you?

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:36.680
Father raised him

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.279
to be the Huo family's watchdog.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.040
I guess you're just jealous of him.

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.040
Governor always says

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.040
you're an embarrassing dandy,

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:52.279
while he's the young marshal
everyone in Sucheng looks up to.

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:56.079
I...

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.040
I will kick you out of here.

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:58.720
Sure.

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:00.600
I'll wait.

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:02.759
But before that,

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.680
show me some respect.

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:06.040
Understood?

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:06.639
Alright.

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:07.319
I get it.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.879
I will.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:10.920
Now go back.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.279
Aren't you afraid

00:07:22.079 --> 00:07:23.279
he'll stir up trouble?

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:25.680
With a brat like him,

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:27.519
you handle him directly.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.279
Even if I put up with him,

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.120
he'll still make trouble.

00:08:05.639 --> 00:08:05.959
Let's go.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.000
Governor,

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.879
the shipment scheduled to arrive tomorrow
from the Sheng family

00:08:11.399 --> 00:08:12.319
has been raided.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.439
They're bold enough to steal my goods.

00:08:20.519 --> 00:08:20.839
Go now.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.040
Find them.

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:24.560
Yes, sir.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:28.700
Stop right there.

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:31.240
Father.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.080
All you do is idle around every day.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.000
Either playing with the violin
or messing around.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:40.960
You've disgraced

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.399
the Huo family.

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:45.240
How have I disgraced the Huo family?

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.679
Here,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.039
I'm nothing but a shame.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:48.919
What did you say?

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.000
You always

00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:51.679
tear me out.

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:53.440
I'm your son,

00:08:53.639 --> 00:08:55.039
but you never give me face.

00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:57.039
Because you don't favor my mother.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.960
You only care about...

00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:02.759
Governor,

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.120
please calm down.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.519
Jin and I

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:06.759
were just fooling around.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I'm stating the truth.

00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:09.679
You neglect my mother.

00:09:09.879 --> 00:09:10.879
Everyone here knows it.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.559
Do you feel no guilt at all?

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:13.879
Father.

00:09:15.919 --> 00:09:18.320
The Huo family's affairs
aren't for an outsider to meddle in.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.399
Yes.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.960
I'm an outsider to you.

00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:30.960
Jin may be mischievous,

00:09:31.919 --> 00:09:34.080
but he's your son.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.480
If you want to hit her, hit me first.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.039
Why take it out on her?

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.639
Investigate

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.600
why the shipment was raided.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.480
So, even you

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.799
can only act obediently

00:10:20.159 --> 00:10:21.759
in front of Governor.

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:26.840
The only one who can quarrel freely
with him is Huo Jin.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:28.639
I'm the one

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:31.559
at his mercy.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:35.879
Bear this in mind.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:37.919
There are no good people

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:39.840
in this house.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.360
Have you heard

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.679
that human nature is evil?

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.639
Someone told me this before.

00:10:54.919 --> 00:10:55.799
She said

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.919
human is born evil.

00:10:58.159 --> 00:10:59.600
But once they understand
love and warmth,

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:02.720
and learn the importance
of morality and order,

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.080
they learn

00:11:05.159 --> 00:11:06.759
to be a good person.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.879
The person who told you this

00:11:11.919 --> 00:11:12.960
must love you very much.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.559
That's why she taught you to see through
human nature in troubled times

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.919
and to be bad

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.120
to protect yourself.

remember.

00:11:46.519 --> 00:11:48.600
Sometimes, you must become a bad person
